Config V2 is a new version of ConfigCat. It comes with a new dashboard, API, SDKs, and features.

[Here](TODO) is how to migrate from Config V1 to Config V2.

## What's new in Config V2?

AND conditions: add more complex targeting rule sets to your feature flags.
Prerequisite flags: feature flags are now able to depend on each other.
Targeting rule notes: add notes to targeting rules to navigate better in complex rule sets.
New comparators: create date based targeting rules and schedule releases, compare arrays etc. - see the docs

## AND conditions

With AND conditions, you can create more complex targeting rule sets for your feature flags. You can add multiple conditions to a targeting rule and they will be evaluated as a logical AND.

## Prerequisite flags

With prerequisite flags, you can create feature flags that depend on other feature flags. Prerequisite feature flags are particularly useful for managing complex feature dependencies and ensuring a smooth user experience during feature rollouts.
