## New features

### AND conditions

With AND conditions, you can create more complex targeting rule sets for your feature flags. You can add multiple conditions to a targeting rule and they will be evaluated as a logical AND.

### New comparators

With the new comparators, you can create date based targeting rules and schedule releases, compare arrays etc.

- New text and sensitive text comparators: EQUALS, NOT EQUALS, STARTS WITH ANY OF, ENDS WITH ANY OF, NOT STARTS WITH ANY OF, NOT ENDS WITH ANY OF.
- New array comparators: ARRAY CONTAINS ANY OF, ARRAY NOT CONTAINS ANY OF.
- New date comparators: BEFORE, AFTER.

### Prerequisite flags

With prerequisite flags, you can create feature flags that depend on other feature flags. Prerequisite feature flags are particularly useful for managing complex feature dependencies and ensuring a smooth user experience during feature rollouts.

### Comparison value hints

With comparison value hints, you can add hints to your comparison values. This way you can add a description to your comparison value list items that helps you remember what they are for.

### Percentage options for targeting rules

You can add percentage options to your targeting rules. This is useful if you want to create percentage options based on your user attributes.

### Custom percentage attributes

With custom percentage attributes, you can create percentage options based on custom attributes. This way you can create percentage options based on any of your user attributes.
