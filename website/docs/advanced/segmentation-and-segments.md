title: Segmentation & Segments
---
Segments allow you to group your users based on any of their properties. This way you can 
define segments of your users and then assign them to specific feature flags. If you update a segment definition, it will update all 
feature flags that are assigned to it.

*For example, you can define a segment called "Beta Users" and assign that segment to all features that you want to be available to beta users.*

You can define your segments on the ConfigCat Dashboard: https://app.configcat.com/product/segments

One segment belongs to one product and can be used in multiple feature flags within the same product.
