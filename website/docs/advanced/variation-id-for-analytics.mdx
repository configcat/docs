---

To support working with feature flags, especially A/B testing and analytics, ConfigCat provides an auto-generated identifier called Variation ID for each distinct served value. This identifier is particularly useful when integrating with analytics tools.

## What is a Variation ID?

The _Variation ID_ is a hashed version of the feature flag's served value. For feature flags with lengthy values (such as JSON objects), the Variation ID provides a shorter, more manageable identifier that can be sent to analytics platforms, instead of the full value.

## How to access Variation IDs

You can view Variation IDs on the ConfigCat Dashboard by enabling the **Show Variation IDs to support A/B testing** setting. Learn more about this setting <a href="https://app.configcat.com/product/preferences" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Variation ID vs. PredefinedVariationID

:::note
`Variation ID` (for analytics) is different from `PredefinedVariationID` available in the Public Management API:

`Variation ID` is a hashed identifier of the feature flag's served value, used for analytics and A/B testing integrations. This is what you send to analytics tools like Amplitude, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Segment.  
`PredefinedVariationID` is the resource identifier in the ConfigCat Public Management API that can be used to reference a specific predefined variation when managing feature flags programmatically. Read more at [Predefined variations](/advanced/predefined-variations).

## Using Variation IDs with analytics integrations

When integrating ConfigCat with analytics platforms, you can send the Variation ID along with (or instead of) the feature flag value. This is especially recommended for text feature flags with lengthy values (such as JSON configurations), maintaining consistent identifiers across analytics reports, and simplifying A/B test analysis.

For detailed integration instructions, see the documentation of
- [Amplitude integration](/integrations/amplitude),
- [Google Analytics integration](/integrations/google-analytics),
- [Mixpanel integration](/integrations/mixpanel),
- [Segment integration](/integrations/segment).
