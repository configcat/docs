This guide will help you migrate from Config V1 to Config V2.

## What is Config V2?

**Config V2 is the next generation of ConfigCat.** It comes with a new Dashboard, Public Management API and SDKs.

**Config V2 supports all the features of V1**, so you can continue using those, but **it offers interesting new features as well**. However, you won't be able to use the new features with the V1 versions of the Dashboard, Public Management API and SDKs.

Read more about the new features in the [Config V2 Overview](../config-v2).

## A few things to consider before migration

- **Migration from Config V1 means that a V2 config will be copied from the V1 config. The V1 config will remain unchanged and accessible.** The V2 version will have a new SDK key for each environment.
- **Config V2 and V1 are completely separate.** They don't affect each other in any way. You can use them side by side.
- **There is no automatic sync between the V1 and V2 configs.** If you want to keep them in sync, you have to manually update the V2 config when you make changes to the V1 config and vice versa.
- There is no pressure to migrate. Although we have plans to phase out V1 eventually, you can stay on it for a long time.
- Once the migration process is started, it's recommended to migrate your V1 configs to V2 as quickly as possible to avoid confusion.
- Keep in mind that the <a href="https://app.configcat.com/integrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrations</a> and <a href="https://app.configcat.com/product/webhooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webhooks</a> connected to V1 configs are not migrated automatically and you have to set them up manually for the migrated V2 configs.
- Every newly created config will be a V2 config by default.

## Migrating from Config V1 to Config V2

The migration process starts with copying your V1 config to a new V2 one and updating your applications to use the new config. The complete process is the following:

### Step 1: Create the V2 config

1. Open the ConfigCat Dashboard and click on the `Start migration` button on top of a V1 config.
2. Click `Create V2 config` to create a new config with the same settings as the V1 config.

It's important to note that the V2 config will be created with the same settings as the V1 config and the V1 config will still be accessible and unchanged.

### Step 2: Upgrade the ConfigCat SDK version

In your application, upgrade the ConfigCat SDK to the latest version. Old versions of the SDK will not be able to access the new config. Make sure you upgrade every application that uses the migrated V2 config.

Here is a list of the SDKs that support Config V2: [See the supported SDK versions.](../config-v2-sdk-compatibility)

### Step 3: Update the ConfigCat SDK Key

In your application, replace the old ConfigCat SDK Key with the new one (i.e. with the one that belongs to the V2 version of the config) in every environment. The new key can be found on the ConfigCat Dashboard on the V2 config's page.

### Step 4: Deploy your application

Deploy your application to production and wait until all your users upgrade to the new version.
You can check the migration status on the ConfigCat Dashboard under the migration status page that is available from a config's context menu in the sidebar.

### Step 5: Clean up

After confirming that all your users have transitioned to the latest version of your application, you can finalize the migration by removing the V1 config. 

To verify that the V1 configs haven't been accessed for a significant period, check the migration status page accessible via a config's context menu in 
the sidebar. This step helps eliminate any mix-ups and prevents the unintended use of outdated configurations.

:::caution
Once you delete the V1 config, you won't be able to restore it.
