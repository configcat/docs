title: Data Governance - CDN
description: ConfigCat customers can control the geographic location where their data will be published to. Helps to stay compliant with GDPR and other data protection regulations.
---

ConfigCat's Data Governance feature gives you control over how and where your config JSONs are published and served from. This helps you comply with regional data handling requirements such as GDPR. 

## CDN - Data Centers

To ensure high availability and low response times worldwide, ConfigCat provides multiple global data centers, each with multiple CDN nodes for built-in redundancy and failover. 

### ConfigCat Data Center locations

ConfigCat uses Cloudflare Edge Cache Network to deliver the configuration JSONs to the SDKs. Read more about Cloudflare data centers [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/).

## How to govern the data?

Currently available geographical areas:

### Global [Default]

Provides geo-location based load balancing on all nodes around the globe to ensure the lowest response times.

### EU Only

Compliant with GDPR. This way your data will never leave the EU.

## Set preferences on the Dashboard

Open <a href="https://app.configcat.com/organization/data-governance">Data Governance page</a> and follow the steps to set preferences.

> Only team members with Organization Admin role can access Data Governance preferences.

## Set up the ConfigCat SDK in your application code

Make sure the `dataGovernance` parameter is passed to the ConfigCat SDK
in your application code when it is being initialized.

> The `dataGovernance` parameter value must be in sync with the selected option on
> the Dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

#### What happens if I forget to pass the `dataGovernance` parameter?

The ConfigCat backend will take the Dashboard preference as primary. Having `EU Only` selected on the Dashboard but forgot to pass the proper `dataGovernance` parameter to the SDK. In this case your config JSONs will only published to the EU CDN nodes. And every config JSON download made from your application to any node outside the EU, the request will be redirected automatically to the EU CDN. Recommended to deploy a fix with the correct `dataGovernance` param, since response times will be significantly longer.

#### `Warning: Your dataGovernance parameter at ConfigCatClient initialization is not in sync with your preferences...`

**Don't worry,** your feature flags will still be served. See above example.
