The following issues were reported by customers. We've collected what we've learned and provided possible solutions.

## Long response times and connection issues

First, check the [Service Status Monitor](https://status.configcat.com) to see if ConfigCat is up and running or if there any planned maintenance.

### General SDK Checklist

1. Make sure you're using the latest version of the ConfigCat SDK. 
1. Check if you've configured the [Data Governance](../advanced/data-governance.mdx) functionality correctly.
1. Singleton: We strongly recommend using the ConfigCat SDK as a singleton. Initializing the SDK multiple times can cause serious performance issues in production. If you need to use multiple SDK Keys in the same application, create only one _ConfigCat Client_ per SDK Key.
1. Are you using the proper polling mode for your use case? Details on polling modes in the [SDK Docs](../sdk-reference/overview.mdx).
1. Your `Auto Polling` interval might be too frequent Please check the [SDK Docs](../sdk-reference/overview.mdx).
1. In `Manual Polling` mode, it could be a too frequent `forceRefresh()` call in your code, making the SDK download the config JSON often.
1. You can try one of our lightweight sample applications to rule out local issues. Find in the [repository of each SDK](https://github.com/configcat).

### Network Checklist

:::caution
Please, **do not load test** the ConfigCat production infrastructure without our consent.
:::

1. You can check response times manually by navigating to `https://cdn.configcat.com/ping.txt` and opening your browser's network tab.
1. Does the machine/server running your code have access to the above address?
1. You might need to whitelist the following addresses in your firewall: `cdn.configcat.com`, `cdn-eu.configcat.com`, `cdn-global.configcat.com`.

## Too many requests error in Angular

This issue can occure due to Angular's Hot Module Replacement functionality during development. The wrapper class containing the Auto Polling ConfigCat SDK is edited, the Hot Module Replacement can reinitialize the whole class without releasing the old, replaced module's Auto Polling timer.
We believe that this is a rare edge case that only happens during development.

## Python Auto Polling issue with uWSGI web server

The Python SDK's Auto Polling mode utilizes its polling job in a `threading.Thread` object. If you run your application behind an uWSGI web server, the Auto Polling mode may not work as expected because the uWSGI web server disables Python's threading by default. Please [enable threading](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html#enable-threads) or switch to another polling mode in this case.
