The following issues were reported by customers. We've collected what we've learned and provided the possible solutions below.

## Long response times and connection issues

First, check the [Service Status Monitor](https://status.configcat.com) to see if ConfigCat is up and running or if there is any planned maintenance.

### General SDK Checklist

1. Make sure you're using the latest version of the ConfigCat SDK. 
1. Check if you've configured the [Data Governance](../advanced/data-governance.mdx) functionality correctly.
1. Singleton: We strongly recommend using the ConfigCat SDK as a Singleton object. Initializing the SDK multiple times can cause serious performance issues in production. If you need to use multiple SDK Keys in the same application, create only one _ConfigCat Client_ per SDK Key.
1. Are you using the proper polling mode for your use case? Details on polling modes in the [SDK 
Docs](../sdk-reference/overview.mdx).
1. Are you using the right polling interval for `Auto Polling`? Too frequent polling will increase your network traffic. Please check the [SDK Docs](../sdk-reference/overview.mdx).
1. In `Manual Polling` mode, are you calling `forceRefresh()` in your code as frequently as needed? Excessive refreshes will increase your network traffic.
1. You can try one of our lightweight sample applications to rule out local issues. Find in the [repository of each SDK](https://github.com/configcat).

### Network Checklist

:::caution
Please, **do not load test** the ConfigCat production infrastructure without our consent.
:::

1. You can check response times manually by navigating to `https://cdn.configcat.com/ping.txt` and opening your browser's network tab.
1. Does the machine/server running your code have access to the above address?
1. You might need to whitelist the following addresses in your firewall: `cdn.configcat.com`, `cdn-eu.configcat.com`, `cdn-global.configcat.com`.

## Too many requests error in Angular

This issue can occur due to Angular's Hot Module Replacement functionality during development when you have a class that wraps the ConfigCat SDK running in Auto Polling mode and the wrapper class is edited. The Hot Module Replacement may reinitialize the whole class without stopping the ConfigCat SDK's Auto Polling timer in the old, replaced module.

We consider this a rare edge case that only happens during development.

## Python Auto Polling issue with uWSGI web server

The Python SDK's Auto Polling mode runs its polling job in a `threading.Thread` object. If you run your application behind an uWSGI web server, the Auto Polling mode may not work as expected because the uWSGI web server disables Python's threading by default. Please [enable threading](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html#enable-threads) or switch to another polling mode in this case.
