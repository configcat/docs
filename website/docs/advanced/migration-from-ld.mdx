This document is for current LaunchDarkly users who want to migrate to ConfigCat. It guides you through the migration
process while providing information on the technical differences between the two services that you need to be aware of.

Migration can be done on a LaunchDarkly project basis, and migration of a project usually consists of the following
three steps:
1. Migrating LaunchDarkly feature flags and segments to ConfigCat
1. Adjusting the code of your applications to use ConfigCat instead of LaunchDarkly
1. Migrating LaunchDarkly teams and permissions to ConfigCat

ConfigCat provides a wizard-like tool that is able to do the heavy lifting for step 1. However, there is currently
no automation for step 2 and 3. So please expect these steps to require some manual work.

However, before diving into it all, please check [this list](../../sdk-reference/overview) to see if ConfigCat supports
the platform your applications are running on. If not, feel free to [contact us](https://configcat.com/support). Maybe
we can still figure out a way for you to migrate to ConfigCat.

## Getting started

To be able to perform the migration, it's essential that you have a basic understanding of ConfigCat's main concepts and
hierarchy. So, as the very first step, please read through [this brief guide](../../main-concepts).

LaunchDarkly projects correspond to ConfigCat products in the ConfigCat hierarchy. However, as you already know,
products are not standalone entities, they are contained by a ConfigCat organization.

So, to get started with migration, you will need to have a ConfigCat account and be a member of the ConfigCat
organization that you want to host the products corresponding to the projects you plan to migrate from LaunchDarkly.
You will also need to have the Organization Admin permission in that ConfigCat organization to be able to create
products.

* If the target ConfigCat organization does not exist yet, you can create one by <a target="_blank" href="https://app.configcat.com/auth/signup">
signing up</a>. During the signup process, you will have the opportunity to create your own organization, in which
you will have the Organization Admin permission by default.
* Otherwise, you will need to get an invitation to the target ConfigCat organization, and after joining, you will
need to request the Organization Admin permission.

Once the target ConfigCat organization is set up and you have the necessary permissions in it, you can start the actual
migration.

## Migrate LaunchDarkly feature flags and segments to ConfigCat

It is recommended to migrate your LaunchDarkly feature flags and segments to ConfigCat first, using ConfigCat's official
import tool, which was designed for this specific purpose.

The tool also takes care of creating the corresponding ConfigCat products and environments, and it does everything
possible to reproduce your LaunchDarkly feature flags and segments in ConfigCat so they match the original evaluation
behavior as closely as possible.

### Using the import tool

To launch the import tool, open the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the ConfigCat Dashboard, navigate to the
Organization Overview page, then click the card labeled "Import from LaunchDarkly".

<img alt="Launching the import tool" src="/docs/assets/migration-from-ld/launch-import-tool_192dpi.png" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />

This will take you to a page with a wizard-like UI:

<img alt="The import tool" src="/docs/assets/migration-from-ld/import-tool_192dpi.png" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />

Follow the instructions and go through the steps to perform the import.

Feel free to experiment with the import tool. You can't really cause any irreversible damage by doing so. After
finishing an import, you can delete the imported products in ConfigCat and start over if you are not satisfied with the
result.

It is also possible to re-import products or specific parts of those without having to delete the products created
previously. The import tool is able to update the existing entities with fresh data. However, this may involve undoable
overwriting of existing data, so please be careful. The import tool will warn you if something like this is about
to happen.

### Targeting toggle translation mode

In step 3 of the wizard, you may need to make a decision that might not be self-evident.

LaunchDarkly feature flags have a <a href="https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/toggle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
toggle</a> that allows you to enable or disable targeting for the specific feature flag. However, there is no similar
feature in ConfigCat.

So, in case the LaunchDarkly projects you selected for import contain feature flags where the targeting toggle is turned
off in some of the environments, you need to decide how to work around such cases.

Your options are the following:

#### Ignore targeting toggle and import rules anyway

This will result in an evaluation behavior different from LaunchDarkly. Choose this option if you want to keep your
targeting rules even if the targeting toggle is off.

Please consider the following consequences:

* The state of targeting toggles will be ignored.
* The *off variation* values won't be served.
* The targeting rules will be imported and evaluated as if the targeting toggle was on.

#### Respect targeting toggle and don't import rules

This will result in the same evaluation behavior as in LaunchDarkly. Choose this option if you want your feature flags
to produce the same values as in LaunchDarkly.

Please consider the following consequences:

* The state of targeting toggles will be respected.
* The *off variation* values will be served.
* The targeting rules won't be imported in environments where the targeting toggle is off.

#### Emulate targeting toggle using a prerequisite flag

This is a workaround that combines the upsides of the other two options at the expense of creating extra feature flags.
Choose this option if you want to import your targeting rules in all cases, and also want your feature flags to produce
the same values as they do in LaunchDarkly.

Please consider the following consequences:

* The state of targeting toggles will be respected, however, for each problematic LaunchDarkly feature flag an extra
[prerequisite flag](../../targeting/targeting-rule/flag-condition)
will be created in ConfigCat to emulate the targeting toggle.
* The *off variation* values will be served.
* The targeting rules will be imported and evaluated depending on the state of the extra prerequisite flag.

### About the import operation

After making your choices on what and how to import in the first steps of the wizard, the import tool performs the
operation by importing the selected LaunchDarkly projects one by one. Importing a project consists of two phases:

#### Translation phase

First, the import tool translates the LaunchDarkly project to a ConfigCat product. For more details on how this is done,
please refer to [this document](../migration-from-ld-translation).

It's important to note that the import tool performs translation on a best effort basis. It aims to do translation in
such a way that you get a feature flag evaluation behavior as close to the original as possible. However, since there
are technical differences between LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat, an accurate translation is not possible in every case.

Such problematic cases are called *translation issues*. The import tool detects and collects these issues during
translation, and includes them in the report generated at the end of the import operation so you can review them, and
make the necessary adjustments where necessary.

You can find the list of possible translation issues [here](../migration-from-ld-translation#translation-issues).

#### Import phase

After the translation phase, the import tool loads the result into ConfigCat. This is when the corresponding
ConfigCat product is actually created (or updated if it already exists).

As the import tool has previously performed all the necessary validation and adjustments, generally you shouldn't
encounter any issues during this phase. However, in rare cases failures may occur (most likely, due to a concurrent
modification in ConfigCat).

The import tool notifies you of such cases, and it also includes the failure details in the report.

### Final steps

After finishing the import operation, the import tool displays a summary. This shows you the overall success of each
LaunchDarkly project selected for import.

* If you see success icons next to every project, it means everything went fine, no significant issues were
  detected.
* If you see a warning or error icon next to any project, it means that there are significant issues you need to
  pay closer attention to, and you will almost certainly need to make manual adjustments, or, in case of failure,
  even repeat the import.

In either case, it's highly recommended to download and go through the report. It provides details about the detected
issues, and also includes links to the original and imported entities, which can make it easier for you to look into and
resolve the issues.

## Adjust the code of your applications

The next step in the migration process is to adjust the code of your applications to use ConfigCat instead of
LaunchDarkly to evaluate your feature flags.

This will also require more or less manual work, depending on what API your applications currently use for feature flag
evaluation.

### Adjust a codebase that uses LaunchDarkly SDK

If your applications implement feature flagging by directly consuming the LaunchDarkly SDK API, you will need to
change those parts to use the ConfigCat SDK API. We show how to do this through a simple example.

Let's assume you have the following simple Node.js application:

```js
import LaunchDarkly from "@launchdarkly/node-server-sdk";

const sdkKey = process.env.LAUNCHDARKLY_SDK_KEY ?? "#YOUR-SDK-KEY#";
const client = LaunchDarkly.init(sdkKey);

try {
  await client.waitForInitialization({ timeout: 10 });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`SDK failed to initialize: ${error}`);
  process.exit(1);
}

const context = {
  "kind": "multi",
  "user": {
    "key": "#UNIQUE-USER-IDENTIFIER#",
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "country": "UK"
  },
  "organization": {
    "key": "#UNIQUE-ORG-IDENTIFIER#",
    "address": {
      "city": "London"
    }
  }
};

const flagValue = await client.variation("isAwesomeFeatureEnabled", context, false);

if (flagValue) {
  console.log("Feature is enabled.")
} else {
  console.log("Feature is disabled.")
}

process.exit(0);
```

Let's see now step by step how to convert this code to ConfigCat:

1. Uninstall the LaunchDarkly SDK package, and install the ConfigCat one instead:

   ```bash
   npm uninstall @launchdarkly/node-server-sdk
   npm install configcat-node
   ```
1. Instead of the `LaunchDarkly` namespace, import `configcat`:

   ```js
   import configcat from "configcat-node";
   ```
1. Replace the LaunchDarkly SDK key with the ConfigCat one.

   You can obtain it from the ConfigCat Dashboard, by selecting the config containing the imported feature flag on the
   sidebar, and clicking the "VIEW SDK KEY" button in the top right corner of the page.
1. Instead of a LaunchDarkly client instance, obtain a ConfigCat one:

   ```js
   const client = configcat.getClient(sdkKey, configcat.PollingMode.AutoPoll, {
      maxInitWaitTimeSeconds: 10
   });
   ```

   Please note that the ConfigCat client doesn't maintain a persistent connection to the remote server, but uses different
   polling strategies to get the data necessary for feature flag evaluation. Refer to the [SDK reference](../../sdk-reference/node#creating-the-configcat-client)
   to learn more about the options. For frontend applications and long-running backend services, Auto Polling mode is
   usually a good choice.
1. Adjust the wait-for-initialization logic.
   * When using Auto Polling mode, you can rewrite it like this:
     ```js
     const clientCacheState = await client.waitForReady();
     if (clientCacheState === configcat.ClientCacheState.NoFlagData) {
       /* ... */
       process.exit(1);
     }
     ```

     Please note that the `waitForReady` method is not available on all platforms. On such platforms, you can't really
     implement this logic at the moment. However, you don't really need to as the feature flag evaluation methods wait
     for initialization internally anyway. (It's worth noting that if initialization can't complete within the
     timeout duration specified by the `maxInitWaitTimeSeconds` option, then feature flag evaluation methods will return
     the default value you pass to them.)

     Actually, you only need this wait-for-initialization logic at the startup of your applications if you want to use
     [synchronous feature flag evaluation via snapshots](../../sdk-reference/node#snapshots-and-synchronous-feature-flag-evaluation).
   * For other polling modes, the wait-for-initialization logic doesn't make sense, so just omit it.
1. Rewrite LaunchDarkly contexts to ConfigCat User Objects.

   ConfigCat uses the concept of [User Object](../../targeting/user-object) to pass user and/or session-related contextual
   data to feature flag evaluation. It serves the same purpose as [LaunchDarkly contexts](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/observability/contexts),
   but it's a simpler data structure.

   To be able to convert a context data structure to a User Object one, you will need to do the following:
   * Read [the section on User Objects](../../sdk-reference/node#user-object) in the reference of the SDK for your
     platform.
   * Read [this section](../migration-from-ld-translation#mapping-between-launchdarkly-contexts-and-configcat-user-objects)
     to learn how context paths are mapped to User Object attribute names.

   For an example of such conversion, see the adjusted code at the end of this section.

   Please also keep in mind:
   * Some LaunchDarkly SDKs may [automatically provide additional attributes](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/sdk/features/environment-attributes)
     in contexts. ConfigCat SDKs don't offer a feature like that at the moment, so in case you target such additional
     attributes in your feature flags, you will need to provide them manually in your applications.
   * LaunchDarkly allows multiple attribute values (an array of values) for all clause operators, but ConfigCat
     allows multiple attribute values (an array of strings) for the ARRAY CONTAINS ANY OF / ARRAY NOT CONTAINS ANY OF
     comparators only. This means that it's not possible to specify multiple values for a user attribute if the
     evaluated feature flag contains a [User Condition](../../targeting/targeting-rule/user-condition) that references
     the attribute, but has a comparator other than the two mentioned. Unfortunately, no workaround exists for this case.
1. Rewrite feature flag evaluation calls.

   This step is pretty straightforward as ConfigCat SDKs provide similar evaluation methods to LaunchDarkly SDKs. Those
   methods are named `getValue`, `getValueAsync` or similar.

   A few things to pay attention to:
   * The order of parameters is different. In ConfigCat, the User Object comes last.
   * The ConfigCat feature flag key may be different from the LaunchDarkly one. E.g. if the key starts with a non-letter
     character, or contains a dot, it will be changed by the import tool because such keys are not valid in ConfigCat.
     To see which keys have been changed, look for <a href="/docs/advanced/migration-from-ld-translation#translation-issue-T002">T002</a>
     translation issues in the report.
   * ConfigCat SDKs don't support [automatic camel casing](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/sdk/client-side/react/react-web#flag-keys-in-the-react-web-sdk)
     of feature flag keys.
   * In statically typed languages, ConfigCat evaluation methods require that the default value type and the feature
     flag type match. (Usually, there is [a section about this](../../sdk-reference/node#setting-type-mapping) in the
     SDK reference.)
   * Please be extra careful when evaluating number type feature flags. ConfigCat distinguishes between integer and
     decimal number feature flags. The former must be evaluated using `getValue<int>`, `getIntValue` or similar, while
     the latter must be evaluated using `getValue<double>`, `getDoubleValue` or similar. (JavaScript-based SDKs don't
     have this issue, but you can run into it in other languages.)
   * On some platforms, the ConfigCat client provides asynchronous evaluation methods only. In such cases, synchronous
     feature flag evaluation is usually still possible, [via snapshots](../../sdk-reference/node#snapshots-and-synchronous-feature-flag-evaluation).
     But this works slightly differently from the asynchronous methods, so make sure you understand its behavior and
     possible pitfalls.

By adjusting the example code according to the above, we get this:

```js
import configcat from "configcat-node";

const sdkKey = process.env.CONFIGCAT_SDK_KEY ?? "#YOUR-SDK-KEY#";
const client = configcat.getClient(sdkKey, configcat.PollingMode.AutoPoll, {
  maxInitWaitTimeSeconds: 10
});

const clientCacheState = await client.waitForReady();
if (clientCacheState === configcat.ClientCacheState.NoFlagData) {
  console.error("SDK failed to initialize.");
  process.exit(1);
}

const user = {
  identifier: "#UNIQUE-USER-IDENTIFIER#",
  email: "alice@example.com",
  country: "UK",
  custom: {
    "name": "Alice",
    "organization:key": "#UNIQUE-ORG-IDENTIFIER#",
    "organization:/address/city": "London",
    "/kind": ["user", "organization"],
  }
};

const flagValue = await client.getValueAsync("isAwesomeFeatureEnabled", false, user);

if (flagValue) {
  console.log("Feature is enabled.")
} else {
  console.log("Feature is disabled.")
}

process.exit(0);
```

The conversion can be done in a similar way on other platforms as well. Obviously, there may be minor differences, plus
advanced topics are not covered here, so it's recommended to start this work by going through the SDK reference for
your platform.

### Adjust a codebase that uses OpenFeature

You should have an easier time if feature flagging is done using the [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/intro/)
abstraction in your applications.

In this case, please check [this list](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/openfeature/overview/) to see if a
ConfigCat OpenFeature provider is available for your platform.

If you're out of luck, you can still use the ConfigCat SDK directly as explained in the previous section, or
[contact us](https://configcat.com/support) about the missing OpenFeature provider.

Otherwise, to switch to ConfigCat, you need to do the following:
1. Uninstall the LaunchDarkly OpenFeature provider package, and install the ConfigCat one instead.
1. Adjust the initialization logic.

   Look for a call to `setProvider`, `setProviderAndWait` or similar, and change it so an instance of ConfigCat
   OpenFeature provider is passed to it. (For ConfigCat, use `setProviderAndWait` if possible.)
1. Convert [LaunchDarkly-specific evaluation context objects](https://github.com/launchdarkly/openfeature-node-server?tab=readme-ov-file#openfeature-specific-considerations)
   to have a data structure compatible with ConfigCat.

   This is done in a very similar way to what's described in the previous section. Read [this section](../migration-from-ld-translation#mapping-between-launchdarkly-contexts-and-configcat-user-objects)
   to learn how context paths are mapped to User Object attribute names.

   For example, something like

   ```js
   const evaluationContext = {
     kind: "multi",
     user: {
       targetingKey: "#UNIQUE-USER-IDENTIFIER#",
       name: "Alice",
       email: "alice@example.com",
       country: "UK"
     },
     organization: {
       targetingKey: "#UNIQUE-ORG-IDENTIFIER#",
       address: {
         city: "London"
       }
     }
   };
   ```

   should be converted to this:

   ```js
   const evaluationContext = {
     targetingKey: "#UNIQUE-USER-IDENTIFIER#",
     name: "Alice"
     email: "alice@example.com",
     country: "UK",
     "organization:key": "#UNIQUE-ORG-IDENTIFIER#",
     "organization:/address/city": "London",
     "/kind": ["user", "organization"],
   };
   ```
1. Review feature flag evaluation calls.

   Most of the pitfalls pointed out in the "Rewrite feature flag evaluation calls" part of the previous section applies
   here too.

### Implement experiments and analytics

There are some fundamental differences in the feature flag evaluation process between LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat. In
ConfigCat, feature flag evaluation is entirely implemented within the SDKs, meaning your users' sensitive data never
leaves your system. The data flow is one-way – from ConfigCat CDN servers to your SDKs – and ConfigCat does not receive
or store any attributes of the [User Object](../../targeting/user-object) passed to the SDKs. This design prioritizes
the privacy and security of user data.

However, this has an important consequence: as opposed to LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat cannot provide an out-of-the-box
solution to A/B testing, experiments or other analytics.

For this, you will need an additional service that provides the necessary functionality. Here are some examples of how
you can integrate such tools with ConfigCat to replicate LaunchDarkly's analytics features:
* [Amplitude](../../integrations/amplitude#experiments)
* [Google Analytics](../../integrations/google-analytics)
* [Mixpanel](../../integrations/mixpanel#experiments)
* [Twilio Segment](../../integrations/segment#analytics)

## Migrate LaunchDarkly teams and permissions to ConfigCat

To complete the migration process, you will also need to migrate your teams and permissions from LaunchDarkly.

At the moment, ConfigCat doesn't offer a tool or other automated solution for this task since there are fundamental
differences between the user management and permission systems of the two services.

LaunchDarkly allows more fine-grained access control over resources, while ConfigCat's permission system was designed to
be simpler and easier to understand, at the expense of fewer possibilities for fine-tuning access control.

Therefore, we can only give you some pointers, but this task will inevitably require some effort on your part.

As the first step, we recommend getting familiar with ConfigCat's user management and permission system. You
can find the basic concepts in the following guides:
  * [Organization & Roles](../../organization)
  * [Team Management Basics](../team-management/team-management-basics)

As you can see from this, ConfigCat doesn't use the concept of teams and roles of LaunchDarkly. You can't define such
entities at the organization level, but *permission groups* per product instead.

### Map LaunchDarkly roles to ConfigCat permission groups

Permission groups roughly correspond to LaunchDarkly roles, with a few key differences:
* They are scoped to the product where they are defined.
* There are no [built-in roles](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/account/built-in-roles) like Reader or Writer. To
  recreate these in ConfigCat, you will need to define the corresponding permission groups in each relevant product.
  However, LaunchDarkly's Admin and Owner roles can't really be represented using permission groups. ConfigCat supports
  the concept of [Organization Admin role](../../organization/#organization-admin-role) but it's an organization-level
  permission. You can assign this to users on invite or on your organization's "Members & Roles" page as shown in the
  next section.
* To migrate [custom roles](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/account/custom-roles) to ConfigCat, you will need to
  translate the [policies](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/account/role-concepts#policies) they define to the fixed
  set of permissions offered by ConfigCat permission groups. Obviously, this won't be entirely possible in every case.

With this in mind, create the necessary permission groups in your products, based on the roles defined in your
LaunchDarkly organization.

To set up permission groups for a product, open the ConfigCat Dashboard, select the product on the sidebar, and choose
"Permission Groups" in the top menu.

<img alt="Launching the import tool" src="/docs/assets/migration-from-ld/permission-groups_192dpi.png" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />

### Invite users to ConfigCat and assign them to permission groups

Permission groups also act as per-product teams. Once created, you can assign users to them, who will then have the
permissions specified by the permission group. (A user can only be a member of a single permission group at a time
though.) This is how you map your LaunchDarkly teams to ConfigCat.

However, users don't yet exist in ConfigCat at this point. You need to invite them to ConfigCat first. To do this,
follow [these instructions](../team-management/team-management-basics/#invite-others-to-collaborate).

When inviting users, you will need to choose a product, more specifically, a permission group to invite them to.
This means that they will be automatically assigned to the specified permission groups after signing up. So,
as you have already created the permission groups, ideally you can immediately invite your users to the right
permission groups. (Of course, you may need to do this in batches.)

It can easily happen that you want to add a user to more than one product. In such cases, invite the user to
one of the products (it doesn't matter which one), then, after they've signed up, navigate to the "Members & Roles" page of your
organization, and assign them to the other products too, using the "Change roles" feature of the "Members & Roles"
table.
