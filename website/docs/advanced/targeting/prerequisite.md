A prerequisite feature flag is a type of feature flag that is used to control the availability of another feature flag. It acts as a condition that must be met before the dependent feature flag becomes active. This allows developers to ensure that certain conditions or requirements are fulfilled before users can access a particular feature. Prerequisite feature flags are particularly useful for managing complex feature dependencies and ensuring a smooth user experience during feature rollouts.
