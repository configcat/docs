title: Details of LaunchDarkly to ConfigCat Translation
description: Details of the LaunchDarkly to ConfigCat translation performed by the "Import from LaunchDarkly" tool.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

This document discusses the details of how [ConfigCat's "Import from LaunchDarkly" tool](../migration-from-ld#migrate-launchdarkly-feature-flags-and-segments-to-configcat) translates LaunchDarkly projects to ConfigCat products (i.e., how, in practice, the import tool converts the project
data fetched fromLaunchDarkly's REST API to ConfigCat's Export/Import JSON format).

You need this information if you want to understand
* why the import tool produces the result that it does,
* what issues can arise during translation, and how to solve them,
* what the limitations of translation are.

## Mapping between LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat entities

The table below shows how LaunchDarkly entities are mapped to ConfigCat entities.

| LaunchDarkly entity | Corresponding ConfigCat entity | Notes |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----- |
| project             | [product](../../main-concepts#product) | |
| environment         | [environment](../../main-concepts#environment) | |
| segment             | [segment](../../targeting/targeting-rule/segment-condition#what-is-a-segment-condition-what-is-a-segment) | LaunchDarkly segments are specific to an environment, but ConfigCat segments are specific to a product, so mapped segment names are prefixed with the environment name to avoid ambiguity. |
| feature flag        | [feature flag / setting](../../targeting/targeting-overview#feature-flag--setting) | LaunchDarkly feature flags are directly contained by a project, but ConfigCat feature flags are organized into [configs](../../main-concepts#config), so a config named "Main Config" is created to contain them. |
| targeting toggle    | -                              | No direct translation is possible. More on this [here](../migration-from-ld#targeting-toggle-translation-mode). |
| prerequisites       | -                              | Each prerequisite is translated to a [Targeting Rule](../../targeting/targeting-overview#targeting-rule) containing a [Flag Condition](../../targeting/targeting-rule/flag-condition). |
| individual targets  | -                              | Each target group is translated to a [Targeting Rule](../../targeting/targeting-overview#targeting-rule) containing an IS ONE OF [User Condition](../../targeting/targeting-rule/user-condition). |
| custom rule         | [Targeting Rule](../../targeting/targeting-overview#targeting-rule) | Multiple clauses (i.e. [AND conditions](../../targeting/targeting-rule/targeting-rule-overview/#and-and-or-relationships) in ConfigCat's terminology) are not supported for segments, only for feature flags at the moment. |
| custom rule clause  | [User Condition](../../targeting/targeting-rule/user-condition) or [Segment Condition](../../targeting/targeting-rule/segment-condition) | Some LaunchDarkly clauses cannot be translated to ConfigCat conditions with the same evaluation behavior, or at all. See also [translation issues](#translation-issues) |
| clause attribute reference | [comparison attribute](../../targeting/targeting-rule/user-condition#comparison-attribute) | LaunchDarkly context attribute paths don't always translate to ConfigCat user attribute names directly. See also [this section](#mapping-between-launchdarkly-contexts-and-configcat-user-objects).  |
| clause operator     | [comparator](../../targeting/targeting-rule/user-condition#comparator) | Most LaunchDarkly operators have their counterparts in ConfigCat (there can be minor or major differences between them though), but a few operators are not supported by ConfigCat at all (e.g. "matches" / "does not match"). |
| clause values       | [comparison value](../../targeting/targeting-rule/user-condition#comparison-value) | As opposed to LaunchDarkly, not all counterparts of operators support multiple values. |
| percentage rollout  | [Percentage Options](../../targeting/percentage-options) | In LaunchDarkly, the basis of the grouping can be set for each percentage rollout, while in ConfigCat [Percentage Evaluation Attribute](../../targeting/percentage-options#percentage-evaluation-attribute) can only be set at the feature flag level. |
| default rule        | [trivial / fallback rule](../../targeting/targeting-overview#to-all-users--to-all-other--to-unidentified-value) | |

## Mapping between LaunchDarkly contexts and ConfigCat User Objects

Both LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat support passing user and/or session-related contextual information to feature flag
evaluation, which is essential for targeting: LaunchDarkly offers [contexts](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/observability/contexts),
while ConfigCat offers [User Objects](../../targeting/user-object) for this purpose.

However, the data structure of these is different:
* In LaunchDarkly, in addition to the default user context, it is possible to define and use other, arbitrary
contexts (e.g. device, application, etc.). [Multi-contexts](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/observability/multi-contexts)
and nested objects are also possible.
* On the contrary, ConfigCat's User Object is a simpler data structure, primarily designed for storing user-related
information. However, via custom attributes it's still able to store arbitrary information.

On top of that, LaunchDarkly context attributes are identified by the combination of a context kind and a path
expression, while ConfigCat uses simple attribute names. For this reason, it is necessary to define an unambiguous
mapping between the two.

This is done as shown in the following table:

| LaunchDarkly context kind | LaunchDarkly context attribute path | Corresponding ConfigCat user attribute name |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------- |
| not specified or `user`   | empty string or `/`                 | `/`                                         |
| not specified or `user`   | `key` or `/key`                     | `Identifier`                                |
| not specified or `user`   | `email` or `/email`                 | `Email`                                     |
| not specified or `user`   | `country` or `/country`             | `Country`                                   |
| not specified or `user`   | `Identifier` or `/Identifier`       | `/Identifier`                               |
| not specified or `user`   | `Email` or `/Email`                 | `/Email`                                    |
| not specified or `user`   | `Country` or `/Country`             | `/Country`                                  |
| not specified or `user`   | `name` or `/name`                   | `name`                                      |
| not specified or `user`   | `/address/city`                     | `/address/city`                             |
| `device`                  | empty string or `/`                 | `device:/`                                  |
| `device`                  | `name` or `/name`                   | `device:name`                               |
| `organization`            | `name` or `/name`                   | `organization:name`                         |
| `organization`            | `/address/city`                     | `organization:/address/city`                |
| any                       | `kind` or `/kind`                   | `/kind`                                     |

Please note that:
* Both LaunchDarkly context attribute paths and ConfigCat user attribute names are case-sensitive.
* In ConfigCat, `Identifier`, `Email` and `Country` are predefined attributes. Everything else qualifies as custom
  attributes.
* One-component LaunchDarkly attribute path expressions are always normalized to their unescaped form if possible. E.g.
  `/~0~1x` â†’ `~/x`, but `/~1~00` â†’ `/~1~00` (as `/~0` would be an ambiguous mapping).
* Multi-component LaunchDarkly attribute path expressions are kept as is (unless they contain `:` characters - see
  below).
* Context kinds other than `user` are included as a prefix in the mapped ConfigCat user attribute name, with `:` as the
  separator. Because of this, LaunchDarkly context attribute paths containing `:` characters needs to be escaped to
  avoid ambiguity. E.g. `a:b` -> `/a~;b`, `/a:b` -> `/a~;b`.

## Translation issues

There are technical differences between LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat, therefore it's not always possible to translate all
entities accurately, i.e. so that they are represented identically in ConfigCat, and provide equivalent behavior to the
original. (By equivalent behaviour we primarily mean equivalent evaluation behaviour, i.e. that the evaluation of a
feature flag or segment produces the same result for the same input parameters.)

Such problematic cases are called *translation issues*, and a *severity level* is assigned to them as follows.

ðŸ”´&nbsp;HIGH - The imported entity cannot provide equivalent behavior to the original at all.<br/>
ðŸŸ¡&nbsp;MEDIUM - The imported entity may not provide equivalent behavior to the original in every case.<br/>
ðŸ”µ&nbsp;LOW - The imported entity does not exactly reflect the original in some way, but it is expected to provide
equivalent behavior to the original.

The tables below show the possible translation issues.

        It is also worth noting that the evaluation behavior of "SemVer &lt;=" and "SemVer &gt;=" clauses with multiple

      </td>
      <td>
        In LaunchDarkly, "is (not) one of" clauses can work with string, boolean and number values, but their ConfigCat
        counterparts can work with strings only. This can be a problem in two cases:
        <ol>
          <li>"is (not) one of" clauses with boolean comparison values cannot be translated accurately as ConfigCat
            offers no comparators that work with boolean values at the moment,</li>
          <li>"is (not) one of" clauses with number comparison values may be translated accurately using the = (number)
            / != (number) comparators. These accept a single comparison value though, so clauses with multiple values
            must be expanded into multiple targeting rules or conditions, depending on negation. However, in the
            specific case the expansion is not possible because of subscription / technical limits.</li>

      <td>
        An IS (NOT) ONE OF condition is created in ConfigCat and the non-string values are converted to string.<br/>
        From the perspective of feature flag evaluation this means the following: the ConfigCat SDK will convert
        non-string user attributes to string, and do case-sensitive string comparisons when evaluating the feature flag.
        In the case of boolean and decimal number values this can lead to undesired behavior. E.g. on some platforms,
        the ConfigCat SDK may convert the false boolean value to the string `False`, which won't be matched by an
        IS ONE OF condition having a comparison value `false`. Similarly, there could be subtle differences in decimal
        number to string conversion across various platforms.

        Due to the peculiarities of the LaunchDarkly REST API, the full data model of a feature flag can only be queried

        the feature flag are modified while fetching the feature flag data (e.g. name, variations, etc.) In such cases,
        inconsistencies across environments are possible in the retrieved data.

      <td>
        The import tool can only detect inconsistencies, but cannot do anything about them. Please check whether the
        imported feature flag is set correctly in each environment. Alternatively, you may try to re-import the specific
        feature flag.

## Further technical differences

* As opposed to LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat distinguishes between integer and decimal number feature flags. Therefore, when
  translating number feature flags, the ConfigCat setting type is guessed based on the variation values specified at
  the time of the import.
* For percentage rollouts, LaunchDarkly and ConfigCat use different algorithms to split users into groups. That is,
  even if the percentage values are the same, the distribution of users will be different. In other words,
  [stickiness](../../targeting/percentage-options#stickiness) of percentage rollouts cannot be transferred to
  ConfigCat.
* In LaunchDarkly, all clause operators can work with context attribute value lists. In ConfigCat, most of the
  comparators (counterparts of operators) can work with a single user attribute only. The only exceptions is
  ARRAY IS (NOT) ONE OF.
* In LaunchDarkly, it is possible to control whether or not specific feature flags are visible to mobile and/or
  client-side SDKs ([Client-side SDK availability](https://launchdarkly.com/docs/home/flags/new#make-flags-available-to-client-side-and-mobile-sdks)).
  There is no such feature in ConfigCat, so this preference is ignored. All the feature flags are imported into a single
  config which can be accessed by all kinds of ConfigCat SDKs.
* In LaunchDarkly, it is possible to mark a feature flag as temporary or permanent. There is no such feature in
  ConfigCat. Yet translation preserves this piece of information by adding a tag to the feature flag.
* In LaunchDarkly, it is possible to assign a name to the variations (possible outcomes of the feature flag). There is
  no such feature in ConfigCat at the moment, so these pieces of information are not transferred.
