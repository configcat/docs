description: ConfigCat provides an unlimited number of team members for every subscription plan, even the free one. Here is how to manage your team.

_Team members_ are your friends, colleagues, and clients who work on the same _Product_. You can invite as many of them to your _Product_ as many you want.

The following guide provides an overview of how to manage your team in ConfigCat.

## Invite others to collaborate

1. Click the `Invite Team Members` button on the sidebar.  
   <img src="/docs/assets/invite.png" className="zoomable" alt="Invite Button" />
1. Enter the invitees' email addresses (comma separated list).
1. Select a _Permission group_ and click on **SEND INVITATION EMAIL**.
1. An invitation will be sent to the invitees' email addresses.

You can modify their permission group later anytime.

## Managing Team Members (Product level)

You can manage your team on the <a href="https://app.configcat.com/product/members" target="_blank">Team Members page</a> of every Product.

_Organization Admins_ have unlimited access to every Product under an Organization, their permissions can't be edited under the product. [Read more on Organization Management](/organization.md)

## Managing Team Members (Organization level)

Only _Organization Admins_ can manage Organization level permissions.

To manage organization members, go to:
[Organization Members & Roles page.](https://app.configcat.com/organization/members)

## Permissions & Permission Groups (Product level)

_Permission groups_ are collections of permissions. They help you organize the permissions into groups that are meaningful to you. You can control your _Team members_ permissions by assigning them to _Permission groups_.

Manage _Permission Groups_ on the [Permission Groups page](https://app.configcat.com/product/permission-groups) of every Product.

## 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

Enforce 2FA for your team members to increase the security of your organization. Go to the [Authentication Preferences](https://app.configcat.com/organization/authentication/) page to enable 2FA. You need to be an organization admin to do this.

## Auto-assign users

All new users who sign up with a [verified email domain](/docs/advanced/team-management/domain-verification) can be automatically added to your organization.
Furthermore, you can also set which Organization roles / Product permissions they should get upon on-boarding.

Read more about [Auto-assigning users](/docs/advanced/team-management/auto-assign-users).

## SSO (Single Sign-On)

You can let your organization members sign in to ConfigCat using 3rd party SSO (Single Sign-On) providers.
