You can let your organization members sign in to ConfigCat using 3rd party SSO (Single Sign-On) providers.

Go to the [Authentication Preferences](https://app.configcat.com/organization/authentication/) page to set up 3rd party SSO. You need to be an
organization admin to do this.

Currently supported SSO providers:

- Google
- Azure Active Directory
- GitHub
- Bitbucket
- Microsoft

Under the `Login / Sign up methods` section you can enable / disable SSO providers one by one. These are organization level preferences. Your selection
will be applied to all members of your organization.

### SAML SSO

SAML SSO allows your team members to sign up and log in to ConfigCat via their company accounts using your own Identity Provider (IdP)
