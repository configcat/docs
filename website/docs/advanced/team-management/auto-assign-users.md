All new users who sign up with a [verified email domain](/docs/advanced/team-management/domain-verification) will be automatically added to your organization.
Furthermore, you can also set which Organization roles / Product permissions they should get upon on-boarding.

#### Steps to configure:

- Open your organization's authentication settings on the <a href="https://app.configcat.com/organization/authentication" target="_blank">ConfigCat dashboard</a>.
