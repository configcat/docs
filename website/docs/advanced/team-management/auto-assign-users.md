description: New users will be automatically added to your organization if you have a verified domain. Here is how to set it up.
---

All new users who sign up with a [verified email domain](/docs/advanced/team-management/domain-verification) will be automatically added to your organization.
Furthermore, you can also set which Organization roles / Product permissions they should get upon on-boarding.

## Steps to configure:

- Open your organization's authentication settings on the <a href="https://app.configcat.com/organization/authentication" target="_blank">ConfigCat dashboard</a>.

- Select which domain you want to configure, and click `RE-CONFIGURE` (or just `CONFIGURE` if you didn't configure it yet) under the `Auto-assign status`.
