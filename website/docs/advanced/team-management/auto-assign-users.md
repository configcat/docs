All new users who sign-up with a [verified email domain](./domain-verification) will be automatically added to your organization.
Furthermore, you can set which automatically assigned permissions / roles they should get upon signing up.

#### Steps to configure:
- Open your organization's authentication settings on the <a href="https://app.configcat.com/organization/authentication" target="_blank">ConfigCat dashboard</a>.
