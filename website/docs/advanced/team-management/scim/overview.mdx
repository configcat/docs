This section describes how you can configure User provisioning (SCIM) for your organization in ConfigCat.

User provisioning (SCIM) is for synchronizing users and groups from your Identity Provider. You have the option to assign ConfigCat permissions to each synchronized Identity Provider (IdP) group. Each member in those groups will be put into the configured ConfigCat permission groups during the provisioning process.

Go to the [User provisioning (SCIM)](https://app.configcat.com/organization/user-provisioning/) page to set up User provisioning. You need to be an organization admin to do this.

## Prerequisites

- [Verified domain](../domain-verification.mdx)  
  In order to configure User provisioning (SCIM), you have to verify the ownership of the domain that your company uses for email addresses. 
- Identity Provider that supports SCIM 2.0 

## Supported SCIM 2.0 endpoints

- Identity Provider User synchronization (Read, Create, Replace, Update, Delete)
- Identity Provider Group synchronization (Read, Create, Replace, Update, Delete)

## Configure an Identity Provider

For setting up SCIM synchronization, you have to configure your Identity Provider with a SCIM URL and a bearer token.  
The SCIM URL and the bearer token can be acquired on the [User provisioning (SCIM)](https://app.configcat.com/organization/user-provisioning/) page.

We tested and validated the following Identity Providers:

- [Entra ID (Azure AD)](./identity-providers/azure-ad.mdx)
- [ADFS](./identity-providers/adfs.mdx)
- [Google](./identity-providers/google.mdx)
- [Okta](./identity-providers/okta.mdx)
- [Auth0](./identity-providers/auth0.mdx)
- [OneLogin](./identity-providers/onelogin.mdx)
- [Cloudflare Zero Trust](./identity-providers/cloudflare.mdx)

:::info
Other Identity Providers might also work with ConfigCat, if they support the SCIM 2.0 protocol.
:::

:::info
The very first synchronization won't affect the current permissions in ConfigCat until you start the provisioning for each synchronized user.
New users are not created automatically. Existing users' permissions will not change until you explicitly start the provisioning for them.
:::

## Configure Identity Provider Groups

After a successful synchronization from your Identity Provider to ConfigCat, the synchronized Identity Provider Groups and Identity Provider Users should be visible on the [User provisioning (SCIM)](https://app.configcat.com/organization/user-provisioning/) page.
You can configure ConfigCat permissions to each Identity Provider Group by clicking on the gear icon in the Identity Provider Groups table. 
By setting up their permission configuration, you can control which ConfigCat permission will be assigned to each group's member.

As an Identity Provider User can be a member in multiple Identity Provider Groups, the user provisioning is merging the permissions associated with the Identity Provider Groups based on the following rules:
- If any of the Identity Provider User's Identity Provider Groups is assigned to the Organization Admin role, the Identity Provider User will be assigned to the Organization Admin role.
- If any of the Identity Provider User's Identity Provider Groups is assigned to the Billing Manager role, the Identity Provider User will be assigned to the Billing Manager role.
- If none of the Identity Provider User's Identity Provider Groups is assigned to the Organization Admin role, the user provisioning will merge the product level permissions associated with each Identity Provider Group. 
  If multiple Identity Provider Groups has permissions associated for the same product, the first Identity Provider Group's permission will be set based on the Identity Provider Groups' priority. 
  You can adjust the Identity Provider Group priorities by clicking on the Set priority button above the Identity Provider Groups table.

### Limitations

ConfigCat limits how many Identity Provider Groups can have associated ConfigCat permissions based on your subscription

| Free    | Pro     | Smart   | Enterprise | Dedicated | Student | Teacher |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| 2       | 5       | 10      | unlimited  | unlimited | 5       | 5       |

### Example

A ConfigCat organization has 2 products and each product has several permission groups:

| Product   | Permission groups                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Product A | Readers, Writers, Developers        |
| Product B | Readers, Product owners, Developers |

There are 5 Identity Provider Groups that are marked for synchronization with the following permissions:

| Priority | Identity Provider Group   | Associated ConfigCat Permissions            |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1.       | Owners                    | Organziation Admin, Billing Manager         |
| 2.       | Billing Managers          | Organziation Admin                          |
| 3.       | Developers                | Product A/Developers, Product B/Developers  |
| 4.       | Product owners            | Product B/Product owners                    |
| 5.       | Readers                   | Product A/Readers, Product B/Readers        |

The Identity Provider Users calculated ConfigCat permissions will be the following based on their Identity Provider Groups:

| Identity Provider User | Identity Provider Groups  | Calculated ConfigCat Permissions                        | Explanation |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | 
| John                   | Owners, Readers           | Organziation Admin, Billing Manager                     | As John is assigned to the Owners Identity Provider Group that has the Organization Admin role, the Readers Identity Provider Group's product level permissions won't be assigned as he is already an Organization Admin. |
| Jane                   | Readers, Billing Managers | Billing Manager, Product A/Readers, Product B/Readers   | A ConfigCat user can have the Billing Manager role and Product level permissions too, so the permissions are merged based on the Identity Provider Groups. |
| Peter                  | Readers, Developers       | Product A/Developers, Product B/Developers              | As both the Readers and Developers Identity Provider Groups have associated permissions to the same Products, the permissions will be merged based on the Identity Provider Group's priority |

## Configure Identity Provider Users

After a successful synchronization, the Identity Provider Users will be connected with existing ConfigCat users in your ConfigCat Organization.  
New ConfigCat accounts are not created automatically. Existing ConfigCat users' permissions will not change until you explicitly start the provisioning for them.

### What is managed by provisioning?

The User Provisioning feature manages the following user related attributes if you start provisioning the Identity Provider User:
- **ConfigCat permissions**: with a fine-tuned provisioning configuration you can manage your team members permissions with your Identity Provider easily.
- **ConfigCat account's email address**: if an Identity Provider User's email address has been changed in the Identity Provider, the associated ConfigCat user's email address will be changed too and the ConfigCat user will only be able to log in with the new email address.
- **ConfigCat account's full name**: the Identity Provider User's full name is synchronized from the Identity Provider and overwrites the ConfigCat user's full name property.
- **Soft delete**: if an Identity Provider User is soft deleted in the Identity Provider, the ConfigCat account will be disabled and cannot be used.
- **Hard delete**: if an Identity Provider User is hard deleted in the Identity Provider, the ConfigCat account will be removed from the organization entirely but the ConfigCat account won't be deleted for a while.

### Start/stop provisioning

In the Identity Provider Users table, you can see a start/stop button in the last column. This indicates if an Identity Provider User's provisioning is running or not. 
As long as the provisioning is not started, you can adjust your Identity Provider Groups' provisioning configurations till the permissions for your Identity Provider Users match the expected permissions without having to worry about changing existing users' permissions.
The provisioning status column can give you an overview what will happen if you start the provisioning for the Identity Provider User.

If you start the provisioning for an Identity Provider User that already has a ConfigCat account, the provisioning permissions will overwrite their current permissions.  
If you start the provisioning for an Identity Provider User that doesn't have a ConfigCat account yet, we will send them an invitation email to let them know that they can start using ConfigCat. After they register an account, their permissions will be set based on the permissions you see in the Identity Provider User table.

:::info
After you start provisioning an Identity Provider User, you won't be able to set their permissions manually on the team members/organization members pages. The permissions can only be changed via changing the permissions in the Identity Provider Groups table, or modifying the Identity Provider Groups associated with the Identity Provider Users in your Identity Provider.
:::

If you stop the provisioning an Identity Provider User, their permissions will stay in the last state, and modifying provisioning permissions or changing the Identity Provider User's Identity Provider Groups won't change their permissions. You'll be able to manually modify permissions for provisioning stopped Identity Provider Users on the team members/organization members pages.  
After turning back the provisioning the permissions may change regarding the actual provisioning configurations.

### Provisioning status

The Provisioning status column in the Identity Provider Users table shows you important information about the provisioning state.

#### Identity Provider User with an unverified email domain

The User Provisoning is synchronizing all Identity Provider Users from your Identity Provider regardless if the Identity Provider User's email domain is a verified email domain in ConfigCat or not.  
The Provisioning status will show an error message regarding this issue and you won't be able to start provisioning for Identity Provider User until you verify the email domain.

#### Identity Provider User without a ConfigCat account

The Provisioning status shows you information about what permissions will be assigned and what will happen to the Identity Provider User after a successful sign up.  
The Provisioning status will show you a warning if an Identity Provider User's won't have any permissions in ConfigCat after a sign up so you can fine-tune your provisioning configuration.

#### Identity Provider User with an already existing ConfigCat account

If provisioning the Identity Provider User is stopped, the provisioning status shows information about what will happen to the ConfigCat account when you start provisioning is started. 
If provisioning the Identity Provider User is started the provisioning status can be:
- **Provisioning is active**: the provisioning is active, all permissions/user properties are matching your Identity Provider configuration for the Identity Provider User.
- **Provisioning is in progress**: the provisioning is happening in a background job, so for a short period of time you can see the provisioning is in progress status. This can happen if your Identity Provider sends ConfigCat updates about your Identity Provider User or you modify your Identity Provider Group's provisioning permissions.

## Auto provisioning for new users

By default, after the Identity Provider synchronizes a new Identity Provider User to ConfigCat, the Identity Provider User will be in a provisioning stopped state, so you can verify your configuration/permissions and adjust your settings if needed.  
After you are confident that the provisioning works like you expect, you can turn the **Auto provisioning for new users** toggle to ON to immediately start the provisioning for newly synchronized Identity Provider Users. 

## Disabling Domain Auto-assign

After verifying your domain name in ConfigCat, all users signing up with that domain will added to your organization. With the auto-assign feature, you can also specify the initial permissions for these users.  
The auto-assign feature of verified domains may interfere with user provisioning. If you want to allow only provisioned users to enter your organization, you should deactivate the auto-assign feature on verified domains. You can do it by deactivating the auto-assign feature next to the verified domains.

## ConfigCat users not managed by user provisioning

After configuring the user provisioning and synchronizing your Identity Provider Users from your Identity Provider, it may happen that there are some ConfigCat accounts in your organization who are not synchronized by the User Provisioning. There could be two possible reasons for this:
- It may happen that these accounts are not added to your Identity Provider synchronization accidentally and these accounts should be set up for synchronization too. This can be done in your Identity Provider.
- If these accounts are not existing anymore in your company, you can safely remove them from your ConfigCat Organization in the *ConfigCat users not managed by user provisioning* table.
