description: Learn about Free-form values and Predefined Variations in ConfigCat, how they differ, and when to use each approach for managing feature flag values.
---

ConfigCat supports two types of feature flag configurations: **Free-form values** and **Predefined Variations**. This guide explains the differences between these approaches and helps you choose the right one for your use case.


## Overview

Feature flags in ConfigCat can be configured in two ways:

- **Free-form values** - Define values directly each time you set a feature flag's value
- **Predefined Variations** - Create a set of reusable variation definitions that can be selected from a dropdown


## Free-form values

Free-form values are the traditional approach where you manually specify the exact value each time you configure a feature flag's value.

### Characteristics

- **Direct Input**: You type or input the value directly when setting up flag rules
- **Ad-hoc Definition**: Values are defined on-the-fly as needed
- **No Reusability**: Each value must be entered separately for each rule
- **Simple Setup**: Straightforward for basic use cases
- **Flexible**: Any valid value can be entered at any time

### Use Cases

Free-form values work well when:
- You have simple, one-off configurations
- Feature flag values are unique and unlikely to be reused
- You need quick setup without upfront planning
- Working with primitive values (booleans, simple strings/numbers)
- Values change frequently or unpredictably


## Predefined Variations

Predefined Variations allow you to define a library of reusable values upfront when creating a feature flag. These variations can then be selected from a dropdown when configuring rules and targets. Each variation consists of three fields:

### Variation fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Value** | Yes | The actual value that will be returned by the feature flag in your application when this variation is selected. |
| **Name** | No | A human-readable identifier for the variation displayed in the dropdown. If not provided, a string representation of the value is displayed instead. |
| **Hint** | No | Additional context or description to explain when or why to use this variation. It will be visible as a tooltip. |

### Characteristics

- **Defined at Creation**: Variations must be defined when creating the feature flag
- **Reusability**: Define once, use multiple times across rules and targets
- **Consistency**: Ensures the same values are used throughout your configuration
- **Dropdown Selection**: Choose from predefined options instead of typing

### Use cases

Predefined Variations are ideal when:
- You have a standard set of values used across multiple rules
- Consistency is critical (e.g., color schemes, API endpoints, configuration objects)
- Multiple team members need to understand what each value represents
- You want to prevent typos or invalid values
- Complex values (JSON objects) need to be reused
- You need to provide guidance on when to use specific values
- Values are known upfront and relatively stable

## Converting between Free-form values and Predefined Variations

ConfigCat provides an easy way to convert feature flags between Free-form values and Predefined Variations.

### Converting to Predefined Variations

When you convert a feature flag from Free-form values to Predefined Variations:

- ConfigCat automatically collects all currently used values from your existing rules and targets
- These collected values are presented as suggested variations but you can modify their names/hints and add new ones
- The conversion happens without affecting your running applications

### Converting to Free-form values

When you convert a feature flag from Predefined Variations to Free-form values:

- The actual values from variations are extracted
- Feature flag values are updated to use the raw values directly
- Names and hints are removed (only values remain)

## Working with Predefined Variations

### Creating a feature flag with Predefined Variations

- Navigate to create a new feature flag
- Select your flag type (string, number, boolean)
- Choose the Predefined Variations mode
- Add as many variations as needed
- Create the feature flag

### Adding/removing/changing Predefined Variations

- You can create additional variations as needed at any time
- You can only remove a Predefined variation if it is not used currently in your feature flag values.
- You can modify the Predefined variations' names and hints anytime
- You can only modify the value of the Predefined variation if it is not used currently in your feature flag values.

## When to use each type

### Choose Free-form values when:
- Prototyping or experimenting
- One-off configurations unlikely to be reused
- Simple boolean flags
- Quick testing scenarios
- Values are unpredictable or change frequently
- Maximum flexibility is needed

### Choose Predefined Variations when:
- Multiple team members work with the flags
- Values are used in multiple rules or targets
- Consistency and standardization are important
- Working with complex JSON configurations
- Need to provide context about value usage
- Want to prevent configuration errors
- Values are known upfront and relatively stable
- Team needs guidance on which values to use when
- Want self-documenting configurations

## VariationID for analytics

When working with feature flags, especially for A/B testing and analytics purposes, ConfigCat provides a **VariationID** for each evaluated feature flag value. This VariationID is particularly useful when integrating with analytics tools.

### What is a VariationID?

The VariationID is a hashed version of the feature flag's value. For feature flags with lengthy values (such as JSON objects), the VariationID provides a shorter, more manageable identifier that can be sent to analytics platforms instead of the full value.

### How to access VariationIDs

You can view VariationIDs on the ConfigCat Dashboard by enabling the **Show VariationIDs to support A/B testing** setting. Learn more about this setting <a href="https://app.configcat.com/product/preferences" target="_blank">here</a>.

### VariationID vs. PredefinedVariationID

:::note
The **VariationID** (for analytics) is different from the **PredefinedVariationID** available in the Public Management API:

- **VariationID**: A hashed identifier of the evaluated feature flag value, used for analytics and A/B testing integrations. This is what you send to analytics tools like Amplitude, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Segment.
- **PredefinedVariationID**: A resource identifier in the ConfigCat Public Management API that can be used to reference a specific predefined variation when managing feature flags programmatically.
:::

### Using VariationIDs with analytics integrations

When integrating ConfigCat with analytics platforms, you can send the VariationID along with (or instead of) the feature flag value. This is especially recommended for:

- Text feature flags with lengthy values (e.g., JSON configurations)
- Maintaining consistent identifiers across analytics reports
- Simplifying A/B test analysis
