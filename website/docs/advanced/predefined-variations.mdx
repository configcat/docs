description: Learn about Plain Values and Predefined Variations in ConfigCat, how they differ, and when to use each approach for managing feature flag values.
---

ConfigCat supports two types of feature flag configurations: **Plain Values** and **Predefined Variations**. This guide explains the differences between these approaches and helps you choose the right one for your use case.

---

## Overview

Feature flags in ConfigCat can be configured in two ways:

- **Plain Values** - Define values directly each time you set a feature flag value.
- **Predefined Variations** - Create a set of reusable variation definitions that can be selected easily.

---

## Plain Values

Plain Values are the traditional approach where you manually specify the exact value each time you configure a feature flag rule or target.

### Characteristics

**Direct Input**: You type or input the value directly when setting up flag rules
**Ad-hoc Definition**: Values are defined on-the-fly as needed
**No Reusability**: Each value must be entered separately for each rule
**Simple Setup**: Straightforward for basic use cases
**Flexible**: Any valid value can be entered at any time

### Use Cases

Plain Values work well when:
You have simple, one-off configurations
Flag values are unique and unlikely to be reused
You need quick setup without upfront planning
Working with primitive values (booleans, simple strings/numbers)
Values change frequently or unpredictably

### Example

```
Setting Rule 1: Return "blue"
Setting Rule 2: Return "red"
Setting Rule 3: Return "green"
```

Each color value is manually typed for each rule.

---

## Predefined Variations

Predefined Variations allow you to define a library of reusable values upfront when creating a feature flag. These variations can then be selected from a dropdown when configuring rules and targets. Each variation consists of three fields:

### Variation Fields

#### 1. Value (Required)
The actual value that will be returned by the feature flag when this variation is selected.

**Type**: Depends on the flag type (string, number, boolean, JSON)
**Purpose**: The technical value used by your application
**Modification**: Can only be updated if the variation is not currently used in any active rules
**Example**: `#0066FF`, `50`, `{"theme": "dark", "fontSize": 14}`

#### 2. Name (Optional)
A human-readable identifier for the variation displayed in the dropdown.

**Type**: String
**Purpose**: Helps team members quickly identify the variation in the ConfigCat Dashboard
**Display**: Shown in the dropdown when selecting variations
**Fallback**: If not provided, a string representation of the value is displayed instead
**Modification**: Can be updated at any time
**Best Practice**: Use clear, descriptive names
**Example**: `Primary Blue`, `Standard Discount`, `Dark Mode Config`

#### 3. Hint (Optional)
Additional context or description to explain when or why to use this variation.

**Type**: String
**Purpose**: Provides guidance to team members about the variation's purpose or usage
**Modification**: Can be updated at any time
**Best Practice**: Include relevant context, constraints, or warnings
**Example**: `"Use for promotional campaigns only"`, `"Approved by design team on 2025-11-15"`, `"Experimental - monitor performance"`

### Characteristics

**Defined at Creation**: Variations must be defined when creating the feature flag
**Reusability**: Define once, use multiple times across rules and targets
**Consistency**: Ensures the same values are used throughout your configuration
**Dropdown Selection**: Choose from predefined options instead of typing
**Self-Documenting**: Names and hints provide context and reduce errors
**Managed Lifecycle**: Variations can be modified or removed with usage-based restrictions

### Variation Lifecycle

**Creation**: Variations are defined when the feature flag is created
**Name Modification**: Can be edited at any time without restrictions
**Hint Modification**: Can be edited at any time without restrictions
**Value Modification**: Can only be edited if the variation is not currently used in any active rules or targets
**Removal**: A variation can only be deleted if it is not currently used in any active rules or targets
**Protection**: Active variations are protected from value changes and deletion to prevent breaking configurations

### Use Cases

Predefined Variations are ideal when:
You have a standard set of values used across multiple rules
Consistency is critical (e.g., color schemes, API endpoints, configuration objects)
Multiple team members need to understand what each value represents
You want to prevent typos or invalid values
Complex values (JSON objects) need to be reused
You need to provide guidance on when to use specific values
Values are known upfront and relatively stable

### Example

**Define Variations at Flag Creation:**
```
Variation 1:
  Name: "Primary Blue"
  Value: "#0066FF"
  Hint: "Brand color - use for primary CTAs"

Variation 2:
  Name: "Alert Red"
  Value: "#FF0000"
  Hint: "Use only for error states and critical alerts"

Variation 3:
  Name: "Success Green"
  Value: "#00CC66"
  Hint: "Confirmation messages and success indicators"
```

**Dropdown Display:**
When configuring rules, you will see:
```
[Primary Blue ▼]
[Alert Red ▼]
[Success Green ▼]
```

**Use in Multiple Rules:**
```
Rule 1: If user is in beta group → Return [Primary Blue ▼]
Rule 2: If user has premium plan → Return [Primary Blue ▼]
Rule 3: If error rate > 5% → Return [Alert Red ▼]
```

Select from dropdown instead of typing hex codes repeatedly.

**Without Names:**
If you do not provide names, the dropdown would show:
```
[#0066FF ▼]
[#FF0000 ▼]
[#00CC66 ▼]
```

## Differences Between Plain Values and Predefined Variations

### Plain Values
Values are entered manually each time you create a rule
No predefined structure or reusability
Maximum flexibility - any value can be entered at any time
No built-in documentation or context
Best for temporary, experimental, or unique configurations

### Predefined Variations
Values are defined once when creating the feature flag
Selected from a dropdown when configuring rules
Names and hints provide context and documentation
Ensures consistency across all rules
Values can only be changed if not currently in use
Names and hints can be updated anytime
Best for standardized, team-based configurations

---

## Converting Between Plain Values and Predefined Variations

ConfigCat provides an easy way to convert feature flags between Plain Values and Predefined Variations.

### Converting to Predefined Variations

When you convert a feature flag from Plain Values to Predefined Variations:

**Automatic Collection**: ConfigCat automatically collects all currently used values from your existing rules and targets
**Variation Creation**: These collected values are presented as suggested variations
**Customization**: You can add names and hints to each variation
**Seamless Transition**: Existing rules are automatically updated to reference the new variations
**No Downtime**: The conversion happens without affecting your running applications

**Example:**
```
Current Flag (Plain Values):
  Rule 1: Return "blue"
  Rule 2: Return "red"
  Rule 3: Return "blue"

After Conversion (Predefined Variations):
  Variation 1: Name: "Blue", Value: "blue", Hint: ""
  Variation 2: Name: "Red", Value: "red", Hint: ""
  
  Rule 1: Return [Blue ▼]
  Rule 2: Return [Red ▼]
  Rule 3: Return [Blue ▼]
```

### Converting to Plain Values

When you convert a feature flag from Predefined Variations to Plain Values:

**Value Extraction**: The actual values from variations are extracted
**Rule Update**: Rules are updated to use the raw values directly
**Loss of Metadata**: Names and hints are removed (only values remain)
**Flexibility Gained**: You can now enter any value without restriction

**Example:**
```
Current Flag (Predefined Variations):
  Variation 1: Name: "Primary Blue", Value: "#0066FF", Hint: "Brand color"
  Variation 2: Name: "Alert Red", Value: "#FF0000", Hint: "Errors only"
  
  Rule 1: Return [Primary Blue ▼]
  Rule 2: Return [Alert Red ▼]

After Conversion (Plain Values):
  Rule 1: Return "#0066FF"
  Rule 2: Return "#FF0000"
```

## Working with Predefined Variations

### Creating a Feature Flag with Predefined Variations

Navigate to create a new feature flag
Select your flag type (string, number, boolean, JSON)
Choose the Predefined Variations mode
Define your variations:
**Value** (required): The actual value your application will receive
**Name** (optional): A descriptive identifier shown in the dropdown
**Hint** (optional): Additional context or usage guidelines
Add as many variations as needed
Save the feature flag

### Modifying Predefined Variations

You can modify variations with the following rules:

#### Name (Anytime)
:white_check_mark: Update the display name anytime
No impact on existing rules
Improves clarity in the dropdown

#### Hint (Anytime)
:white_check_mark: Update guidance text anytime
No impact on existing rules
Helps team members make better decisions

#### Value (Restricted)
:warning: Can only change if the variation is not currently used in any active rules or targets
If in use, you must first remove all references to the variation
Prevents accidental breaking changes to active configurations

#### Add New Variations
:white_check_mark: Create additional variations as needed at any time
No restrictions on adding new variations

### Removing Predefined Variations

Variations can only be removed if they meet these conditions:

:white_check_mark: Not currently referenced in any active targeting rules
:white_check_mark: Not currently used in percentage rollouts
:white_check_mark: Not set as the default value
:x: Cannot remove if actively used (protection against breaking changes)

**Workflow for Removing a Variation:**
Identify all rules using the variation you want to remove
Update those rules to use different variations
Once the variation is no longer in use, it can be safely deleted

### Best Practices

#### Naming Conventions
Use descriptive, meaningful names
Consider your team's domain language
Be consistent across similar flags
Remember: if no name is provided, the value itself appears in the dropdown
Examples:
:white_check_mark: `High Performance Mode` (better than showing the JSON value)
:white_check_mark: `Legacy API Endpoint` (clearer than the URL)
:white_check_mark: `Free Tier Limit` (more readable than `100`)
:x: `Option 1` (too generic)
:x: `Test Value` (not descriptive)
:x: `Var 2` (meaningless)

#### Naming for Complex Values
For JSON or complex values, names are especially valuable:
:white_check_mark: `Dark Mode Configuration` instead of `{"theme": "dark", "contrast": "high", ...}`
:white_check_mark: `Enterprise Features Bundle` instead of `{"ai": true, "analytics": true, ...}`
:white_check_mark: `US East API Cluster` instead of `{"region": "us-east-1", "endpoints": [...], ...}`

#### Writing Effective Hints
Explain **when** to use the variation
Mention any **constraints** or **prerequisites**
Include **who approved** or **when added** if relevant
Reference **related documentation** if applicable
Examples:
`"Use during peak traffic hours (9 AM - 5 PM)"`
`"Requires backend version >= 2.5.0"`
`"Approved for EU region only - GDPR compliant"`
`"Experimental - monitor performance closely"`
`"Deprecated - migrate to 'New Primary Blue' by Q2 2026"`

#### Value Management
Keep values focused and purposeful
For JSON values, validate structure before saving
Document value format/schema in the hint if complex
Consider versioning for complex configurations
Plan variations upfront during flag creation
Remember: once a variation is in use, its value cannot be changed
If you need to change a value in use, create a new variation and migrate rules

#### Planning Variations
Think through all possible values before creating the flag
Consider future use cases and growth
Balance between too few (limiting) and too many (overwhelming)
Group related values logically
Leave room for future additions
Consider creating variations even if only one rule uses them initially

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Theme Configuration (Predefined Variations)

**Problem**: Multiple developers need to configure theme settings consistently across different targeting rules.

**Solution**: Use Predefined Variations

```
Variation: "Light Theme"
Value: {"theme": "light", "primaryColor": "#FFFFFF", "textColor": "#000000"}
Hint: "Default theme - use for general audience"

Variation: "Dark Theme"
Value: {"theme": "dark", "primaryColor": "#1a1a1a", "textColor": "#FFFFFF"}
Hint: "Opt-in theme - requires user preference setting"

Variation: "High Contrast"
Value: {"theme": "high-contrast", "primaryColor": "#000000", "textColor": "#FFFF00"}
Hint: "Accessibility mode - WCAG AAA compliant"
```

**Benefits**:
No risk of JSON syntax errors
Consistent theme objects across all rules
Clear guidance on when to use each theme
Dropdown shows "Light Theme" instead of the entire JSON object
Easy to update names and hints as requirements evolve

### Scenario 2: API Rate Limits (Predefined Variations)

**Problem**: Different user tiers have different rate limits that need to be applied consistently.

**Solution**: Use Predefined Variations

```
Variation: "Free Tier"
Value: 100
Hint: "100 requests/hour - default for new users"

Variation: "Pro Tier"
Value: 1000
Hint: "1,000 requests/hour - requires active subscription"

Variation: "Enterprise Tier"
Value: 10000
Hint: "10,000 requests/hour - contact sales for higher limits"
```

**Benefits**:
Rate limits are standardized across all rules
Dropdown shows "Free Tier" instead of just "100"
Self-documenting for team members
Prevents accidental misconfiguration
Can update hints without affecting active rules

### Scenario 3: Quick A/B Test (Plain Values)

**Problem**: Testing a simple button label change for a short-term experiment.

**Solution**: Use Plain Values

```
Rule 1: 50% of users → "Get Started"
Rule 2: 50% of users → "Start Free Trial"
```

**Benefits**:
Quick setup without upfront planning
Temporary test does not need long-term structure
Simple strings do not require standardization
Easy to remove after test completes
Can iterate rapidly on different text variations

### Scenario 4: Feature Rollout Strategy (Predefined Variations)

**Problem**: Rolling out a new feature with different configuration stages.

**Solution**: Use Predefined Variations

```
Variation: "Disabled"
Value: {"enabled": false}
Hint: "Feature completely disabled"

Variation: "Beta - Internal"
Value: {"enabled": true, "mode": "beta", "analytics": true, "debugMode": true}
Hint: "Internal testing only - full debug logging enabled"

Variation: "Limited Release"
Value: {"enabled": true, "mode": "limited", "analytics": true, "debugMode": false}
Hint: "10% of production users - monitor metrics closely"

Variation: "General Availability"
Value: {"enabled": true, "mode": "production", "analytics": false, "debugMode": false}
Hint: "Full production rollout - optimized performance"
```

**Benefits**:
Clear progression through rollout stages
Complex JSON configurations guaranteed correct
Team understands the purpose of each stage
Dropdown shows "Beta - Internal" instead of complex JSON
Easy to move users between stages
Can update hints to reflect current rollout status

### Scenario 5: API Endpoint Configuration (Predefined Variations)

**Problem**: Multiple environments with different API endpoints that must be exact.

**Solution**: Use Predefined Variations

```
Variation: "Production"
Value: "https://api.production.example.com/v2"
Hint: "Primary production endpoint - use for all GA traffic"

Variation: "Production Backup"
Value: "https://api-backup.production.example.com/v2"
Hint: "Failover endpoint - use only during primary outage"

Variation: "Staging"
Value: "https://api.staging.example.com/v2"
Hint: "Pre-production testing - data may be reset weekly"

Variation: "Development"
Value: "https://api.dev.example.com/v2"
Hint: "Development environment - unstable, for testing only"
```

**Benefits**:
Zero chance of typos in critical URLs
Names make it clear which environment you are selecting
Hints provide critical usage information
If endpoint URLs change, update once (if not in use) rather than in every rule
Team members cannot accidentally use wrong endpoints

---

## Summary

Predefined Variations provide enhanced reusability, consistency, and team collaboration for feature flag management. While Plain Values remain useful for simple or experimental scenarios, Predefined Variations offer the structure and documentation needed for professional, team-based feature flag operations.

**Key Takeaways:**
**Plain Values**: Flexible, ad-hoc, best for simple or temporary configurations
**Predefined Variations**: Structured, reusable, best for standardized values across teams
**Conversion**: Easy migration between types with intelligent value collection
**Field Modification Rules**:
**Name & Hint**: Can be updated anytime
**Value**: Can only be updated if not currently in use
**Deletion**: Only possible if not currently in use
**Three Fields**: 
**Value** (required, technical value)
**Name** (optional, shown in dropdown, falls back to value string if empty)
**Hint** (optional, provides context and guidance)

By leveraging Predefined Variations effectively, you can create a self-documenting feature flag system that scales with your team and reduces configuration errors.
