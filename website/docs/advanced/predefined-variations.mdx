description: Learn about free-form values and predefined variations in ConfigCat, how they differ, and when to use each approach for managing feature flag values.
---

ConfigCat supports two value-modes for feature flags: _free-form values_ and _predefined variations_. This guide explains the differences between these approaches and helps you choose the right one for your use case.


## Overview

In ConfigCat, you can configure feature flags to operate in either of these modes:

- **Free-form values** - Allows arbitrary feature flag values. You can set served values to any value.
- **Predefined variations** - Constrains feature flag values to a set of variations specified beforehand. You can select served values from a dropdown.

## Free-form values
Free-form values are the traditional, unrestrictive mode that lets you enter a feature flag's exact value each time you set it.

</p>

### Characteristics

- **Direct Input**: You type or input the value directly when setting up flag rules
- **Ad-hoc Definition**: Values are defined on-the-fly as needed
- **No Reusability**: Each value must be entered separately for each rule
- **Simple Setup**: Straightforward for basic use cases
- **Flexible**: Any valid value can be entered at any time

### Use cases

Free-form values work well when you have simple, one-off configurations where feature flag values are unique and unlikely to be reused. They're ideal when you need quick setup without upfront planning, especially when working with primitive values like booleans or simple strings and numbers. This approach is also suitable when values change frequently or unpredictably.



## Predefined variations

Predefined variations allow you to define a set of reusable values upfront when creating a feature flag. These variations can then be selected from a dropdown when setting up flag rules. Each variation consists of three fields:

</p>

### Variation fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Served value | **Required.** The actual value that feature flag evaluation will return in your application when this variation is selected. |
| Display name | Optional. A human-readable identifier for the variation displayed in the dropdown. If not provided, a string representation of the served value is displayed instead. |
| Hint | Optional. Additional context or description to explain when or why to use this variation. It will be visible as a tooltip. |

### Characteristics

- **Defined at Creation**: Variations must be defined when creating the feature flag
- **Reusability**: Define once, use multiple times across flag rules
- **Consistency**: Ensures the same values are used throughout your configuration
- **Dropdown Selection**: Choose from predefined options instead of typing

### Use cases

Predefined variations are ideal when you have a standard set of values used across multiple rules, especially when consistency is critical for things like color schemes, API endpoints, or configuration objects. They work well when multiple team members need to understand what each value represents and you want to prevent typos or invalid values. This approach is particularly valuable when complex values like JSON objects need to be reused, when you need to provide guidance on when to use specific values, and when values are known upfront and relatively stable.


## Converting between free-form values and predefined variations

ConfigCat provides an easy way to convert feature flags between free-form values and predefined variations.

### Converting to predefined variations

When you convert a feature flag from free-form values to predefined variations, ConfigCat automatically collects all currently used values from your existing flag rules. These collected values are presented as suggested variations, but you can modify their display names and hints, or even add new variations.

The conversion doesn't affect your deployed applications.

### Converting to free-form values

When you convert a feature flag from predefined variations to free-form values, the actual values from variations are extracted and feature flag values are updated to use the values directly. Display names and hints are irreversibly deleted, leaving only the values.

The conversion doesn't affect your deployed applications.

## Working with predefined variations

### Creating a feature flag with predefined variations

When creating a new feature flag, you can choose between free-form values and predefined variations.

### Managing predefined variations

You can add/remove/modify predefined variations for a feature flag by clicking the related button in any served value dropdowns or by clicking the **Manage predefined variations** item in the kebab (3 dots) menu of the feature flag.  

<p>
    <img src="/docs/assets/predefined-variations/manage_192dpi.png" alt="Clone feature flag" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
</p>

You can create additional variations as needed at any time. However, you can only remove a predefined variation if it is not currently in use.  

You can modify the display name and hint of predefined variations at any time, but you can only change the served value of a predefined variation if it is not currently in use.


## Variation ID for analytics

To support working with feature flags, especially A/B testing and analytics, ConfigCat provides an auto-generated identifier called Variation ID for each distinct served value. This identifier is particularly useful when integrating with analytics tools.

### What is a Variation ID?

The _Variation ID_ is a hashed version of the feature flag's served value. For feature flags with lengthy values (such as JSON objects), the Variation ID provides a shorter, more manageable identifier that can be sent to analytics platforms, instead of the full value.

### How to access Variation IDs

You can view Variation IDs on the ConfigCat Dashboard by enabling the **Show Variation IDs to support A/B testing** setting. Learn more about this setting <a href="https://app.configcat.com/product/preferences" target="_blank">here</a>.

### VariationID vs. PredefinedVariationID

:::note
`VariationID` (for analytics) is different from `PredefinedVariationID` available in the Public Management API:

`VariationID` is a hashed identifier of the feature flag's served value, used for analytics and A/B testing integrations. This is what you send to analytics tools like Amplitude, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Segment.  
`PredefinedVariationID` is the resource identifier in the ConfigCat Public Management API that can be used to reference a specific predefined variation when managing feature flags programmatically.
:::

### Using Variation IDs with analytics integrations

When integrating ConfigCat with analytics platforms, you can send the Variation ID along with (or instead of) the feature flag value. This is especially recommended for text feature flags with lengthy values (such as JSON configurations), maintaining consistent identifiers across analytics reports, and simplifying A/B test analysis.

For detailed integration instructions, see the documentation of
- [Amplitude integration](/integrations/amplitude),
- [Google Analytics integration](/integrations/google-analytics),
- [Mixpanel integration](/integrations/mixpanel),
- [Segment integration](/integrations/segment).
