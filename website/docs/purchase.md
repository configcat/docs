## Plans

ConfigCat is a feature flag service with unlimited team size, awesome support, and a reasonable price tag. You can use ConfigCat by subscribing with an email address which is free forever. Additionally, we offer three more plans
with fewer limitations and more additional features. For a detailed comparison <a href="https://configcat.com/pricing/" target="_blank">check out the pricing table</a>.

If you need a comprehensive table of all the business and technical limits of each plan, see the [Subscription Plan Limits Table](subscription-plan-limits).

### Shared vs Dedicated infrastructure

**Free, Pro, Smart, Enterprise plans** run on shared infrastructure. So all the customers are using the same API and Config Delivery Network.

**Hosted** plan have dedicated API and CDN nodes for their exclusive use, fully separated from the shared infrastructure.
Dedicated customers can also drop their nodes to preferred geographic locations.

**On-Premise** plan includes only the distribution of the ConfigCat service via <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container" target="_blank">Docker containers</a>.
So customers can run the service on their own infrastructure.

### Self-service vs Assisted plans

**Free, Pro, Smart plans** are self-service. Using any of those plans should not require manual assistance from the ConfigCat team.

**Enterprise, Hosted, On-Premise plans** include manual assistance from the ConfigCat team like filling forms,
provide reports, review contracts or set up bank transfers.
