description: This is a step-by-step guide on how to get started with ConfigCat feature flags and on how to implement feature flags in an application.
---

This page is an overview and a short guide on how to get started.

**ConfigCat** is a cloud-based service that lets you release features without code deployments.

You can use it with many similar techniques such as feature flags/toggles, canary releases, soft launches, A-B testing, remote configuration management, and phased rollouts. Configure your application and features even after deployment.

## The birth of a Feature Flag

First, **add a feature flag** on the _ConfigCat Dashboard_,
then you can **connect your application** to the ConfigCat service to access your feature flag.

### Create a feature flag on the _ConfigCat Dashboard_

1. <a href="https://app.configcat.com/login" target="_blank">Log in</a> to the _Dashboard_
2. Click _ADD FEATURE FLAG_ and give it a name.

### Connect your application

There are ready to use code snippets for `.NET`, `Java`, `Android (Java)`, `Kotlin`, `iOS`, `Dart (Flutter)`, `Node`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, `Go`, `PHP`, `Elixir`, `C++` on the <a href="https://app.configcat.com" target="_blank">ConfigCat Dashboard</a>, just scroll down to the **SDK Key and steps to connect your application** section.

All the ConfigCat SDKs are open-source and available on <a href="https://github.com/configcat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

See the detailed [Docs on how to use the ConfigCat SDKs.](/sdk-reference/overview.md)

Here's a short example to demonstrate the concept:

```js
var configcat = require('configcat-client');
var client = configcat.createClient('YOUR SDK KEY HERE');

client.getValue('isMyFeatureEnabled', false, (value) => {
  if (value === true) {
    do_the_new_thing();
  } else {
    do_the_old_thing();
  }
});
```
