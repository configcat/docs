description: This page explains how to use The Zombie Flags Report to list all feature flags that weren't flipped for a while.
---

Zombie flags, also known as stale feature flags, are feature flags that are no longer needed or rarely used. Over time, they contribute to technical debt and, if left unmanaged, may cause unintended errors, performance issues, or bloated codebases. 

## What Are Zombie (Stale) Feature Flags?

Zombie flags typically form when: 

- A feature flag originally controlled a feature that has since become permanent, and the flag is no longer needed. 

- A decision was made to keep a feature on or off, yet the flag still lingers in your code or DevOps workflow.

- The flag was used for a one-time deployment or experiment that is now complete. 

- You haven't toggled the flag in a long time.

## Managing Zombie Flags

The Zombie Flags (Stale Flags) Report helps you identify feature flags that haven't been updated or flipped for a while. These flags are most likely obsolete but still referenced in your source code. 

### How to Set Up Zombie Feature Flags Report


1. Log in to your [ConfigCat dashboard](https://app.configcat.com/my-account/zombie-flags-report).
2. Click your Organization name in the top-right corner.
3. Select  **My Zombie Flags Report** from the dropdown menu.

### Exploring the My Zombie Flags Report Page

On the My Zombie Flags Report page, you can customize the report to fit your workflow:

- **Receive Report via Email:** Get regular email updates with stale flag info. 
- **Frequency:** Set how often you'd like to receive the report (e.g., weekly or monthly).
- **Criteria:** Define how long a flag must be inactive before it's marked as stale.
- **Scope:** Choose to include all feature flags or only the ones you're watching. 
- Environment: Select the ConfigCat [**environment**](https://configcat.com/docs/main-concepts/#environment) for which you want to analyze flags.

## Sample Email Report

Once your preferences are set, ConfigCat will email you a Zombie Flags Report. Here's a preview of what that report may look like:

## Other Tools for Identifying Unused Feature Flags

In addition to the Zombie Flags Report, we offer other tools to help you clean up unused flags: 

- [**Scan & Upload Code References**](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/code-references/overview) : Track where feature flags appear in your code. 
- [The ConfigCat CLI](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/cli): Detect flags still in your code that no longer exist in the ConfigCat Dashboard. 
- [GitHub Action](https://configcat.com/docs/integrations/github/) and [CircleCI Orb](https://configcat.com/docs/integrations/circleci): Find feature flags in your code that you might want to remove.
