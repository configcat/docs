description: This page explains how to use The Zombie Flags Report to list all feature flags that weren't flipped for a while.
---

My Zombie Flags Report is a ConfigCat feature that helps you identify stale or unused feature flags—also known as zombie flags—in your projects. Removing these outdated flags can reduce technical debt, improve performance, and simplify your codebase.

## What Are Zombie (Stale) Feature Flags?

Zombie flags are feature flags that are no longer needed or actively used. They often remain in the codebase long after their purpose has been fulfilled.

Common scenarios where zombie flags appear:

- A temporary feature becomes permanent, but its flag is never removed.
- A flag was introduced for a one-time rollout or experiment that's now complete.
- A decision was made to always keep a feature on or off, making the flag redundant.
- The flag hasn't been toggled or referenced for an extended period.

## Why Removing Zombie Flags Matters

Leaving stale flags in your code can lead to:
- **Increased complexity:** Unused flags clutter code and reduce maintainability.
- **Unexpected behavior:** Outdated flags might trigger legacy logic unintentionally.
- **Longer onboarding and reviews:** Developers waste time reviewing obsolete logic.
- **Performance degradation:** In large-scale systems, excess flags can slow down operations.

## About the My Zombie Flags Report

My Zombie Flags Report scans your ConfigCat environments and identifies feature flags that haven't been updated or toggled within a specified timeframe. It highlights flags that are likely obsolete but still present in your source code or workflows.

### How to Set Up Zombie Feature Flags Report

1. Log in to your [ConfigCat dashboard](https://app.configcat.com/my-account/zombie-flags-report).
2. Click your Organization name in the top-right corner.
3. Select  **My Zombie Flags Report** from the dropdown menu.

### Exploring the My Zombie Flags Report Page

On the My Zombie Flags Report page, you can customize the report to fit your workflow:

- **Receive Report via Email:** Get regular email updates with stale flag info. 
- **Frequency:** Set how often you'd like to receive the report (e.g., weekly or monthly).
- **Criteria:** Define how long a flag must be inactive before it's marked as stale.
- **Scope:** Choose to include all feature flags or only the ones you're watching. 
- **Environment:** Select the ConfigCat [environment](https://configcat.com/docs/main-concepts/#environment) for which you want to analyze flags.

## Sample Email Report

Once your preferences are set, ConfigCat will email you a Zombie Flags Report. Here's a preview of what that report might look like:

## Other Tools for Identifying Unused Feature Flags

In addition to the My Zombie Flags Report, ConfigCat provides several tools to help you detect and clean up unused feature flags:

- [Scan & Upload Code References](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/code-references/overview): Track where feature flags appear in your code. 
- [The ConfigCat CLI](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/cli): Detect flags still in your code that no longer exist in the ConfigCat Dashboard. 
- [GitHub Action](https://configcat.com/docs/integrations/github/) and [CircleCI Orb](https://configcat.com/docs/integrations/circleci): Find feature flags in your code that you might want to remove.
