## Feature Flag or Setting

A _Setting_ is an essential bit of _ConfigCat_. It can be of multiple types, such as an on/off switch (bool), number (int, double) or any text (string). You can use it to change your application's behavior remotely, without a new deployment.

A _Feature Flag_ is a _Setting_ of type Bool.

### Anatomy of a _Feature Flag_ or _Setting_

| Properties | Description                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name       | A human readable name that differentiates the _Setting_ on the _ConfigCat Dashboard_. e.g., `My Cool Feature enabled`. |
| Key        | A variable name within your code. e.g., `isCoolFeatureEnabled`.                                                        |
| Hint       | A hint to help you remember the purpose of your _Setting_.                                                             |
| Type       | Type of information you'd like to keep in the _Setting_. e.g., On/Off Toggle, Text, Number                             |
| Value      | The actual value of your _Setting_. e.g., `true`, `false`. Can be different in each environment.                       |

### About _Setting_ types

| Setting Kind   | Setting Type | Description                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| On/Off Toggle  | Boolean      | true/false, usually referenced as Feature Flag, Feature Toggle or Feature switch. |
| Text           | String       | Any string, max. 100000 characters, can't be empty.                               |
| Whole Number   | Integer      | Any whole number within the range of `Int32`.                                     |
| Decimal Number | Double       | Any decimal number within the range of `double`.                                  |

### Free-form values vs predefined variations

A _Feature flag_ or _Setting_ can be defined to use free-form values or _predefined variations_.

Free-form values allows you to set any value of the _Setting_ type in each environment without any restrictions.  
It is especially useful if you don't know which values you want to set for a _Feature flag or Setting_ in the future.

_Predefined variations_ allows you to define the _Feature flag_ or _Setting_'s possible values in advance. 
The possible values can be edited later, but you cannot set the _Feature flag_ or _Setting_'s value to a custom value, you can only choose from the predefined variations.  
It is useful if you want to restrict the _Feature flag_ or _Setting_'s value to a set of predefined values and don't want to allow any other values to be set. e.g. A/B/n testing scenarios.

:::info
You can easily convert a _Feature flag_ or _Setting_ from using free-form values to using _predefined variations_ and vica versa.

#### Anatomy of a _predefined variation_

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value        | Required. The actual value of your _Setting_. e.g., `true`, `false`.                                                                                                                          |
| Display name | Optional. The display name will be visible while selecting the _predefined variation_ for the _Feature flag_ or _Setting_. If not set, the feature flag's value will act as the display name. |
| Hint         | Optional. A hint to help you remember the purpose of the _predefined variation_. It will be visible as a tooltip.                                                                             |

## Config

A _Config_ is a collection of _Settings_. _Configs_ help you organize settings around topics, or around your software components. A _Config_ is like an online version of a traditional config file.

## Environment

An environment in ConfigCat represents an environment in your development lifecycle (like production, staging, development etc.). Different environments have the same settings but can have different values.
:::info
Each environment-config pair has its own SDK Key which must be used to initialize the ConfigCat SDK within your application.
:::

## Product

A collection of _Configs_, _Environments_ and _Team members_. A _Product_ typically represents your application (or your service) and the people working on it. It might be a good idea to invite others to your _Product_ to collaborate.

## Organization

An _Organization_ represents a collection of preferences that are valid for all the _Products_ and _Members_ who belong to
an _Organization_. Like billing information, authentication rules or data privacy preferences.
