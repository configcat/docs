## Feature Flag or Setting

A _Setting_ is an essential bit of _ConfigCat_. It can be of multiple types, such as an on/off switch (bool), number (int, double) or any text (string). You can use it to change your application's behavior remotely, without a new deployment.

A _Feature Flag_ is a _Setting_ of type Bool.

| Name       | A human readable name that differentiates the _Setting_ on the _ConfigCat Dashboard_. e.g., `My Cool Feature enabled`. |
| Key        | A variable name within your code. e.g., `isCoolFeatureEnabled`.                                                        |
| Type       | Type of information you'd like to keep in the _Setting_. e.g., On/Off Toggle, Text, Number                             |
| Value      | The actual value of your _Setting_. e.g., `true`, `false`. Can be different in each environment.                       |

## Config

A _Config_ is a collection of _Settings_. _Configs_ help you organize settings around topics, or around your software components. A _Config_ is like an online version of a traditional config file.

## Environment

An environment in ConfigCat represents an environment in your development lifecycle (like production, staging, development etc.). Different environments have the same settings but can have different values.
:::info
Each environment-config pair has its own SDK Key which must be used to initialize the ConfigCat SDK within your application.

## Product

A collection of _Configs_, _Environments_ and _Team members_. A _Product_ typically represents your application (or your service) and the people working on it. It might be a good idea to invite others to your _Product_ to collaborate.

## Organization

An _Organization_ represents a collection of preferences that are valid for all the _Products_ and _Members_ who belong to
an _Organization_. Like billing information, authentication rules or data privacy preferences.
