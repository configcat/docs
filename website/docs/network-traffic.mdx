description: Network Traffic refers to the data transmitted between your applications and ConfigCat servers.

Network Traffic refers to the data transmitted between your applications and ConfigCat CDN. It includes the requests made to fetch feature flags and settings.

Generally speaking, the Network Traffic is proportional to:
- the size of the `config JSON`, 
- the number of clients connecting to ConfigCat,
- and the frequency of changes in the `config JSON`.

Here are a few examples of config JSON file sizes:

<table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Config JSON complexity</th>
        <th colspan="2">Network Traffic</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th># of feature flags</th>
        <th>Targeting Rules</th>
        <th>first download size</th>
        <th>no change <br/> <code> 304 - Not Modified </code> </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>none</td>
        <td>0.5 kB</td>
        <td>65 B</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>17</td>
        <td>few</td>
        <td>1.6 kB</td>
        <td>65 B</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>370</td>
        <td>many</td>
        <td>159 kB</td>
        <td>65 B</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

#### Size of the `config JSON`
It is affected by the number of feature flags, settings, targeting rules, segments, and the length of their values.

#### Number of clients connecting to ConfigCat
Every time a client downloads the config JSON, it contributes to the overall Network Traffic.

#### Frequency of changes in the `config JSON`
The `config JSON` is cached on the ConfigCat CDN. If there is no change, the ConfigCat CDN will respond with `304 Not Modified`. If there is a change, the ConfigCat CDN will respond with `200 OK` and the new `config JSON` content in the response body.

### Shared infrastructure

The following plans run on shared infrastructure. So all customers use the same API nodes and Config Delivery Network (CDN).

| Plan           | Data / month |
| -------------- | -----------: |
| **Free**       |        20 GB |
| **Pro**        |       100 GB |
| **Smart**      |         1 TB |
| **Enterprise** |         4 TB |

:::info
If you hit this limit, we will keep your application up and running. However, you can expect us to contact you on how we can meet your needs.

### Dedicated infrastructure

The following plans include dedicated API and CDN nodes.

#### Hosted

Runs on dedicated servers provided by ConfigCat.

|                   | Data / month |
| ----------------- | -----------: |
| **Basic package** |        24 TB |

#### On-Premise (Self-hosted)

Runs on the customer's own servers. We suggest <a href="https://configcat.com/support/" target="_blank">contacting ConfigCat's engineering</a> team on exact requirements and performance.

## How to reduce the monthly Network Traffic?

### Delete the old feature flags and unused Targeting Rules

If you have a large number of feature flags and Targeting Rules in a config, you can reduce the size of the `config JSON` by deleting the old ones. The [Zombie Flags](../zombie-flags) feature can help you finding stale feature flags.

### Avoid keeping lots of data in the comparison value of Targeting Rules or segments

The comparison value of a Targeting Rule or segment is stored in the `config JSON` and downloaded by the SDKs. If you have a lot of Targeting Rules or segments with lengthy comparison values, you can reduce the size of the `config JSON` by shortening them.

### Consider the amount of text you keep in a text setting's value

Similarly to the comparison value of Targeting Rules or segments, the value of a text setting is stored in the `config JSON` and downloaded by the SDKs. If you have a lot of text settings with lengthy values, you can reduce the size of the `config JSON` by shortening them.

### Separate your feature flags into multiple configs

If you have a large number of feature flags, you can reduce the size of the `config JSON` by separating them into multiple configs. This way, the payload of each download will be smaller.

### Use the ConfigCat Proxy to cache/proxy config JSON downloads

The [ConfigCat Proxy](./advanced/proxy/overview.mdx) allows you to host a feature flag evaluation and config JSON proxy/cache service within your own infrastructure.  
The [CDN proxy](./advanced/proxy/endpoints.mdx#cdn-proxy) feature allows you to proxy/cache config JSON downloads, and the ConfigCat SDKs can be routed to the ConfigCat Proxy running in your own infrastructure greatly reducing network traffic.

### Purchase additional network traffic

You can purchase an add-on for your subscription to increase your limits. [Contact us](https://configcat.com/support/) for more information.

| Plan           | Price              | Additional config JSON downloads | Additional network traffic |
