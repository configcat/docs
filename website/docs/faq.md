*Solution 2:* Contact your `Organization Admin`, and ask them to disable 2FA for your account until you set it up again.

*Solution 3:* Use your recovery codes that you received when you first set your 2FA up.

## A/B Testing & Targeting

### How do I use AND operators in my targeting rules?
Although there is no direct support for `AND` operators in the UI, you can use the `AND` operator as follows:

ðŸ¤“ Via [De Morgan's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws): `Condtion1 AND Condition2` is equivalent to `NOT (NOT Condition1 OR  NOT Condition2)`.

[Here is an example in our blog.](https://configcat.com/blog/2019/10/23/feature-flags-user-segmentation-and-targeting-examples/#everyone-in-my-company-plus-android-users-from-germany-above-v53)

### Are percentage rules sticky?
Yes. Once you set a percentage rule, it will be applied to the same users. So for example if you set a rule for 10% of your users, no matter how you change the percentage, the rule will be applied to the same users when you go back to 10%.

Also consider the following:
- All SDKs evaluate the rules in the exact same way. (10% is the same 10% in all SDKs)
- The percentage rules are sticky by feature flag. (10% is a different 10% for each feature flag)

### How to use targeting rules based on sensitive data?
If you want to use targeting rules based on email address, phone number, or other sensitive data, you can use the [Sensitve text comparators](https://configcat.com/docs/advanced/targeting/#sensitive-text-comparators).

### How can I be sure, that my data is safe?
The feature flag evaluation is done on the client side in the ConfigCat SDK. So if you are using the SDK, you can be sure that your data will never leave your system.
