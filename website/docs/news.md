We're excited to announce important updates to our Service Level Agreement (SLA) concerning uptime commitments.

We're increasing our uptime commitment for the following plans:

| Uptime Changes  | Previous | Current         |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Free Plan       | 99%      | 99% (No Change) |
| Pro Plan        | 99.8%    | 99.9%           |

By enhancing our SLA terms, we aim to provide a more consistent and trustworthy service that you can depend on, day in and day out.

## Old SDKs will stop working after October 1st, 2023.

#### Aug 10, 2023

All ConfigCat SDKs released before Feb, 2020 will stop working after October 1st, 2023. Please, upgrade all your SDKs to the latest.

Although we aim to keep older SDK versions functional, those trailing more than one major or minor release lack official support and SLA. Many of these outdated SDKs will no longer remain functional.

### Affected SDKs and versions:

| SDK Type | Latest available version | Will stop working |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Python   | v8.0.0                   | < v3.0.2          |

## Introducing Network Traffic limits for all plans

#### Aug 1, 2023

We are introducing [**Network Traffic**](https://configcat.com/docs/network-traffic/) limits for all plans. The usage is based on the Network Traffic your applications are making to the ConfigCat CDN.

### Why are we introducing these limits?

Our cloud provider charges us for the Network Traffic we use to serve your feature flags. By introducing these limits, we can cover these costs and continue providing the service. Instead of raising prices for all users in general, we decided to specifically reflect the network-related operation costs in our current pricing plans.

### What are the limits?

| Free       | Pro         | Smart     | Enterprise |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 20 GB / mo | 100 GB / mo | 1 TB / mo | 4 TB / mo  |

### What to expect?

94% of our users will not be affected by these limits. If you are in the 6% that exceeds the limit, we will reach out to you directly to assist in the next 3 months in finding the best solution for your specific use case. Rest assured that even if you exceed the limit, your feature flags will continue to work seamlessly.

If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to [**reach out to us**](https://configcat.com/support). We're here to help!

## Introducing "Test with User"

#### Jul 26, 2023

## Searching feature flags instead of Ctrl+F

#### Oct 5, 2021

Added a search bar to the feature flags page.

We recommend using it instead of Ctr+F and Cmd+F since the page is lazy loaded. So it might not yield results from parts of the page that are not currently rendered.
