## Connect ConfigCat to hundreds of other apps with Zapier

<a href="https://zapier.com/apps/configcat/integrations" target="_blank">ConfigCat's Zap</a> lets you connect ConfigCat to 8,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

<a href="https://zapier.com/apps/configcat/integrations" target="_blank">ConfigCat's Zap</a> can notify you about feature flag and setting changes, so you can easily set up workflows in Zapier (e.g. Send out a Slack message or e-mail when somebody updated a flag).

## Setup
### Connect ConfigCat
1. Log in to your <a href="https://zapier.com/sign-up" target="_blank">Zapier account</a> or create a new account.
2. Navigate to `App Connections` from the side menu.
3. Click on `Add connection` and search for `ConfigCat` in the `Add new connection` dialog.
4. Click on `Add connection` button to connect ConfigCat.
5. Generate a Public API credential at <a href="https://app.configcat.com/my-account/public-api-credentials" target="_blank">ConfigCat Dashboard</a>.
   Use the generated `Basic auth user name` and `Basic auth password` to connect your ConfigCat account to Zapier.
