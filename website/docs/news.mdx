## Enhanced SDK key filtering with Proxy Profile selection rules

#### Jan 30, 2026

We're happy to announce that we improved the Proxy Profile's SDK key selection mechanism.

In addition to manual configuration, you can now build custom selection rules that respond to future product, config, and environment creation/deletion/renaming.

## More control over your Slack notifications

#### Jan 19, 2026

Good news! We listened to your feedback and made our Slack integration more flexible.

You can now control whether Slack notifications show or hide sensitive targeting data. This gives more context in private channels, while keeping safe defaults for shared ones.

Until now, comparison values used with confidential (hashed) operators were always masked in Slack. This remains the default behavior.

From now on, you can optionally change this setting for existing Slack integrations on the [Integrations page](https://app.configcat.com/product/integrations).  
When creating a new Slack integration, you will be asked during setup whether targeting rule values should be sent in cleartext.

No action is required to keep sensitive data hidden for existing integrations. We recommend keeping this setting disabled for shared or public Slack channels.

## Automatic ConfigCat Proxy configuration with Proxy profiles / OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol

#### Aug 22, 2025

We have two exciting [ConfigCat Proxy](/docs/advanced/proxy/overview.mdx) related news:

1. From the [v2.0.0](https://github.com/configcat/configcat-proxy/releases/tag/v2.0.0) version, 
the Proxy has the ability to use [Proxy profiles](https://app.configcat.com/organization/proxy-profiles) to determine which SDK keys to download and distribute.
   :::info
   You need to be an Organization Admin to access the Proxy profiles page on the Dashboard.
   :::
   <img src="/docs/assets/news/proxy-profiles.png" alt="Proxy profiles page" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
   [See the documentation](/docs/advanced/proxy/overview.mdx#1-automatic-configuration-with-proxy-profiles) for more information on how to set up your Proxy with profiles.

2. From the [v2.0.0](https://github.com/configcat/configcat-proxy/releases/tag/v2.0.0) version, the Proxy conforms to the [OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol](https://github.com/open-feature/protocol) (OFREP), which means it can be used with OFREP compatible OpenFeature providers.
[See the API documentation](/docs/advanced/proxy/endpoints/#openfeature-remote-evaluation-protocol-ofrep) for the OFREP implementation with usage examples.

## New SDK for JavaScript with Cloudflare Workers support

#### Aug 15, 2025

We just released the [new, revamped ConfigCat SDK for JavaScript platforms](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/js/overview/).
Unlike the previous platform-specific SDKs, it ships as a [single, unified NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@configcat/sdk)
that supports multiple JS environments.

<p>
  <img className="monochrome-image theme-aware" src="/docs/assets/news/unified-js-sdk_192dpi.png" alt="Unified NPM package" width="400" height="398" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
</p>

The new SDK combines and, thus, supersedes these SDKs:
* [ConfigCat SDK for JavaScript frontend applications](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/js/)
* [ConfigCat SDK for JavaScript Server-Side Rendered applications](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/js-ssr/)
* [ConfigCat SDK for Node.js](https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/node/)
* [ConfigCat SDK for Chromium Extensions](https://github.com/configcat/js-chromium-extension-sdk)

The legacy SDKs remain available for use but won't receive new features and improvements any more. They will continue
getting security updates until official support ends on August 31, 2026.

The new SDK maintains strong backward compatibility, so in most cases migration is simple and straightforward.
For details, see the "Migration to the new SDK" section in the SDK references linked above.

But there are other advantages to upgrading to the new SDK sooner rather than later:

* Most notably, it adds support for **Deno**, **Bun** and **Cloudflare Workers**. Plus, makes the Browser and 
  Chromium Extension SDKs work in **Web Workers** too.
* Another improvement worth mentioning is that the new SDK is a **zero-dependency library**, which can spare you
  some package management-related headaches. It distributes **ES2017-compatible code** to allow you to minimize the
  library's footprint in your application bundles.
* A nice new feature is **query string-based flag overrides** (especially handy during development) and the possibility
  of **custom flag override data sources** - even with full feature flags, not just simple values (useful for testing).
* Then there is a **new hook** named `configFetched` for observing config fetch errors and **new options** named
  `configFetcher` and `logFilter` for customizing config fetching and logging.
* Error reporting received nice improvements as well: among others, the SDK now includes **error codes** to help identify
  error causes.

For the full list of new features and improvements, take a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/configcat/js-unified-sdk/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Quality of Life improvements

#### Jun 3, 2025

We've just rolled out a set of updates that make working with feature flags in ConfigCat smoother and more practical. Here's what's new:

### Zombie flag Report improvements

Stale feature flags can build up quickly and lead to technical debt. We've improved the Zombie Flags feature to make it more useful and easier to manage:
- **New Zombie Flags page**
    The original email report didn't offer immediate feedback. That's why we created the new [Zombie Flags page](https://app.configcat.com/product/zombie-flags), 
    where you can instantly view stale flags and filter them by product. If you're using our [Code References](../advanced/code-references/overview/) feature, 
    the page also shows exactly where the flags appear in your code, making it easier to clean things up.
- **Ignore flags by tag**
    If you have long-lived feature flags that are meant to stay, you can now tag them (for example, with “permanent”) and exclude them from the Zombie Flags Report.
- **Less noise, more focus**
    The previous report included any flag that was stale in at least one selected environment. 
    Now, you can adjust the settings so only flags that are stale in all selected environments appear in the report.
- **Now available via API**
    You can also check stale flags programmatically using the [Zombie (stale) flags](/api/reference/get-staleflags/) endpoint in our Public Management API.

Narrow down your [Zombie Flags Report](https://app.configcat.com/my-account/zombie-flags-report) email with the new preferences, 
try out our new [Zombie Flags page](https://app.configcat.com/product/zombie-flags), 
or check the [documentation](../zombie-flags/) to learn more.

<p>
    <img src="/docs/assets/news/zombie-page_192dpi.png" alt="Zombie Flags page" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
</p>

### Clone feature flag

Cloning a feature flag now lets you quickly create a new flag in any config. 
It copies over all the targeting rules, values across environments, and tags, making setup faster and more consistent.

<p>
    <img src="/docs/assets/news/clone-feature-flag_192dpi.png" alt="Clone feature flag" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
</p>

### Copy all feature flag rules

We've made it easier to copy flag values across environments. Now, you can:
- Copy rules for an entire config, or
- Choose specific feature flags to copy.

<p>
    <img src="/docs/assets/news/copy-all-feature-flag-values_192dpi.png" alt="Copy all feature flag rules" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
</p>

### A Smoother Flag Creation Experience

When creating a new feature flag, you no longer have to set values separately for each environment. 
You can now set them once globally, then fine-tune as needed later.

We truly hope you'll love these new features and improvements. Happy feature flagging! ❤️

## User provisioning (SCIM) is here!

#### May 21, 2025

**We're happy to announce that ConfigCat now supports user provisioning using SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)!**

SCIM makes it easy to sync users and groups from your Identity Provider into your ConfigCat Organization.
Once synced, you can link Identity Provider groups to ConfigCat permission groups, so users are placed in the right roles without manual work.

We've tested the feature with [Entra ID (Azure AD)](../advanced/team-management/scim/identity-providers/entra-id/), 
[Okta](../advanced/team-management/scim/identity-providers/okta/) and [OneLogin](../advanced/team-management/scim/identity-providers/onelogin/), 
but any Identity Provider that supports the SCIM 2.0 protocol should work too.


SCIM provisioning is available on all ConfigCat plans, including the Free plan. Each plan includes limits for synced users, groups, and permission assignments. See details [here](/subscription-plan-limits/).

Read our [documentation](../advanced/team-management/scim/scim-overview/) and set up the User provisioning on the
[Authentication & Provisioning](https://app.configcat.com/organization/authentication) page in your ConfigCat Dashboard.

:::info
You'll need to be an Organization Admin to access it.

## Import from LaunchDarkly is here!

#### Apr 29, 2025

**Thinking about moving away from LaunchDarkly? ConfigCat just made that easier for you.**

If you're curious about switching to a LaunchDarkly alternative, ConfigCat has good news for you: we've launched a new feature
called the "Import from LaunchDarkly" tool, which makes it a breeze to migrate LaunchDarkly feature flags and segments
into ConfigCat.

It's available on all plans, even the Free plan. So if you're just exploring, you can give it a go with zero commitment.
(Just a heads-up: your plan's limits still apply. If you bump into anything,
<a href="https://configcat.com/support/?prefilled=ld-import-limit" target="_blank">contact us</a>, and we'll surely
figure out a solution for you!)

You can find the import tool on the [Organization Overview](https://app.configcat.com/organization) page in your
ConfigCat Dashboard:

<p>
  <img alt="Launching the import tool" src="/docs/assets/migration-from-launchdarkly/launch-import-tool_192dpi.png" width="1366" height="768" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />
</p>

:::info
You'll need to be an Organization Admin to access it.
:::

If you decide to make the full switch, we've prepared a [migration guide](../advanced/migration-from-launchdarkly) to walk you
through the whole process.

So why not make the jump? You'll land on your paws anyway. :cat:

## Introducing ConfigCat Playground: Test Feature Flags Easily in a safe environment

#### Sept 26, 2024

We've just released the ConfigCat Playground, a simulator that provides a safe virtual environment where you can try out everything ConfigCat has to offer.

This new feature gives you virtual devices and a virtual app that can be connected to your ConfigCat feature flags. This lets you test feature flags and targeting rules without needing to connect any real applications.

Please do not use the Playground with feature flags already connected to live applications. We highly recommend using feature flags from non-production environments when experimenting in the Playground.
        
To get started, simply click on the <strong>"Test in Playground"</strong> option in the <strong>...</strong> menu of any boolean feature flag inside your ConfigCat Dashboard.

<img src="/docs/assets/news/playground.png" alt="ConfigCat Playground" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>

## Introducing Network Traffic limits for all plans

#### Aug 1, 2023

We are introducing [**Network Traffic**](./network-traffic.mdx) limits for all plans. The usage is based on the Network Traffic your applications are making to the ConfigCat CDN.

### Why are we introducing these limits?

Our cloud provider charges us for the Network Traffic we use to serve your feature flags. By introducing these limits, we can cover these costs and continue providing the service. Instead of raising prices for all users in general, we decided to specifically reflect the network-related operation costs in our current pricing plans.

### What are the limits?

| Free       | Pro         | Smart     | Enterprise |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 20 GB / mo | 100 GB / mo | 1 TB / mo | 4 TB / mo  |

### What to expect?

94% of our users will not be affected by these limits. If you are in the 6% that exceeds the limit, we will reach out to you directly to assist in the next 3 months in finding the best solution for your specific use case. Rest assured that even if you exceed the limit, your feature flags will continue to work seamlessly.

If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to [**reach out to us**](https://configcat.com/support). We're here to help!
