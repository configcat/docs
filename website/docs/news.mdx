## Introducing ConfigCat Playground:<br/>Test Feature Flags Easily in a safe environment

#### Sept 26, 2024

We've just released the ConfigCat Playground, a simulator that provides a safe virtual environment where you can try out everything ConfigCat has to offer.

This new feature gives you virtual devices and a virtual app that can be connected to your ConfigCat feature flags. This lets you test feature flags and targeting rules without needing to connect any real applications.

Please do not use the Playground with feature flags already connected to live applications. We highly recommend using feature flags from non-production environments when experimenting in the Playground.
        
To get started, simply click on the <strong>"Test in Playground"</strong> option in the <strong>...</strong> menu of any boolean feature flag inside your ConfigCat Dashboard.

## Introducing the ConfigCat Feature Flags Tutorial

#### Jun 11, 2024

We're excited to launch our [Feature Flags Tutorial](https://tutorial.configcat.com/?lm=13), a comprehensive guide designed to enhance your skills in feature management. 
This tutorial covers everything from basic toggling and simple targeting to advanced techniques like percentage rollouts and handling rollbacks.

### Tutorial Highlights:
- Begin with toggling a feature flag on and off to see its immediate impact on a user interface, simulating real-world user scenarios.
- Simple Targeting: Learn to apply basic targeting rules by enabling a feature for all users except those in a specific country.
- Dogfooding: Practice internal testing by setting the feature to be visible only to users from your company.
- Percentage Rollout: Advance to partial feature deployment by enabling a new feature for a percentage of your users, testing its acceptance incrementally.
- Rollback: Master the ability to quickly revert changes for specific user groups when encountering issues during rollout.

This step-by-step guide is ideal for anyone looking to integrate feature flags into their projects efficiently.

## Some updates regarding SLA guaranteed Uptime

#### Aug 15, 2023

We're excited to announce important updates to our Service Level Agreement (SLA) concerning uptime commitments.

We're increasing our uptime commitment for the following plans:

| Uptime Changes  | Previous | Current         |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Free Plan       | 99%      | 99% (No Change) |
| Pro Plan        | 99.8%    | 99.9%           |
| Smart Plan      | 99.9%    | 99.95%          |
| Enterprise Plan | 99.9%    | 99.99%          |
| Dedicated Plan  | 99.9%    | 99.99%          |

By enhancing our SLA terms, we aim to provide a more consistent and trustworthy service that you can depend on, day in and day out.

## Old SDKs will stop working after October 1st, 2023

#### Aug 10, 2023

All ConfigCat SDKs released before Feb, 2020 will stop working after October 1st, 2023. Please, upgrade all your SDKs to the latest.

Although we aim to keep older SDK versions functional, those trailing more than one major or minor release lack official support and SLA. Many of these outdated SDKs will no longer remain functional.

### Affected SDKs and versions

| SDK Type | Latest available version | Will stop working |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Python   | v8.0.0                   | < v3.0.2          |
| Ruby     | v7.0.0                   | < v2.0.3          |
| .NET     | v8.2.0                   | < v4.0.0          |
| Go       | v8.0.0                   | < v4.0.0          |

| Swift    | v9.4.0                   | < v4.0.0          |

## Introducing Network Traffic limits for all plans

#### Aug 1, 2023

We are introducing [**Network Traffic**](./network-traffic.mdx) limits for all plans. The usage is based on the Network Traffic your applications are making to the ConfigCat CDN.

### Why are we introducing these limits?

Our cloud provider charges us for the Network Traffic we use to serve your feature flags. By introducing these limits, we can cover these costs and continue providing the service. Instead of raising prices for all users in general, we decided to specifically reflect the network-related operation costs in our current pricing plans.

### What are the limits?

| Free       | Pro         | Smart     | Enterprise |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 20 GB / mo | 100 GB / mo | 1 TB / mo | 4 TB / mo  |

### What to expect?

94% of our users will not be affected by these limits. If you are in the 6% that exceeds the limit, we will reach out to you directly to assist in the next 3 months in finding the best solution for your specific use case. Rest assured that even if you exceed the limit, your feature flags will continue to work seamlessly.

If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to [**reach out to us**](https://configcat.com/support). We're here to help!

## Introducing "Test with User"

#### Jul 26, 2023

We're pleased to announce the arrival of "Test with User" for feature flags!

With "Test with User," you can now test your feature flags before deploying them to production. Wondering how your flags will perform for specific users? This feature allows you to see the evaluation results based on a given User Object.

Just updated the UX on the product overview page and added a few small features.

- You can choose from a number of colors for your environments.
