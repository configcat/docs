title: Targeting Overview
description: Overview of the ConfigCat targeting feature with examples.
---

Targeting allows you to enable or disable a feature for specific users or groups of users in your application. Typical use cases are:

- [Beta testing](../../glossary#beta-testing)
- [A/B testing](../../glossary#ab-testing)
- [Phased rollouts, canary releases](../../glossary#canary-release)

## How does it work?

1. On the <a href="https://app.configcat.com" target="_blank">ConfigCat Dashboard</a>, you add
   [Targeting Rules](../targeting-rule/targeting-rule-overview) and/or [Percentage Options](../percentage-options) to your feature flag.
2. You pass a [User Object](../user-object) to the ConfigCat SDK in your application.
3. The ConfigCat SDK will use the User Object and the rules defined on the Dashboard to determine whether the feature should be enabled for the user.

## What is what?

### Feature Flag / Setting

A _setting_ is a set of rules that yields a **boolean**, **string**, **integer** or **double** value, which can be used
to configure your application. It is also known as a configuration value, configuration setting, configuration parameter, etc.

A _feature flag_ is a **boolean** setting used to decide whether an application feature should be turned ON or OFF.
It is also known as a feature toggle, feature switch, feature flipper, conditional feature, etc.

:::info
Throughout this documentation, we generally use the term _feature flag_ to refer to both feature flags and settings for
simplicity because feature flags are the most common type of settings.

### Targeting Rule

A _Targeting Rule_ consists of a collection of conditions and a value to serve. If the conditions are met (the Targeting
Rule _matches_), the value is served, i.e. returned as the result of the feature flag evaluation. More about
Targeting Rules [here](../targeting-rule/targeting-rule-overview).

### Condition

A _condition_ is a logical expression that can be evaluated to true or false. There are three types of conditions:
[User Condition](../targeting-rule/user-condition), [Flag Condition (Prerequisite)](../targeting-rule/flag-condition),
[Segment Condition](../targeting-rule/segment-condition). For a Targeting Rule to match, all of its conditions must evaluate to true.

### Percentage Options

_Percentage Options_ divide users into groups, each receiving a specific value.
The groups are allocated according to the specified percentage split. Percentage Options are often used for A/B testing or
phased rollouts. More about Percentage Options [here](../percentage-options).

### "To all users" / "To all other" / "To unidentified" value

A feature flag always contains a trivial "rule", a simple value after the actual rules. This value is returned when
none of the preceding rules yields a result.

### Default value

The ConfigCat SDK's feature flag evaluation functions (e.g. `GetValue`) require you to provide a _default value_. This
value will be returned in case the SDK fails to fetch the config or some other error occurs during the evaluation of the feature flag.

### User Object

A _User Object_ is a collection of _user attributes_ that describe the properties of a user. Referencing these attributes
in conditions allows you to define rules for targeting users. More about the User Object [here](../user-object).

## Examples

### Phased rollout / Canary release / Percentage rollout scenario

#### Context

Our demo company, Whisker Co. is about to release a new feature called **Park Weather Info**. The stakeholders want to make
sure that the release of the new feature goes smoothly and it is received well by the customers.

#### Goal

To make sure that the new feature is working as expected before releasing it to everyone, we initially want to make the
feature available to the employees and to 20% of the customers only.

#### Solution

Let's create a feature flag called **Enable Park Weather Info** with a Targeting Rule that matches the employees at
Whisker Co. and Percentage Options set to **20% ON** and **80% OFF** for the rest of the users (i.e. for the customers).

Here is what such a feature flag looks like on the Dashboard:
<img alt="Phased rollout example" src="/docs/assets/targeting/targeting-overview/phased-rollout-example_192dpi.png" width="1084" height="553" decoding="async" loading="lazy" />

Here is how we get the value of the feature flag in your application:

```js
// Create the User Object
const userObject = {
  // Used by the Percentage Options to split the users into groups
  identifier: '867428724',
  // Used by the Targeting Rule's User Condition to determine whether
  // the user is an employee at Whisker Co.
  email: 'isaac@whisker.cc',
};

// Get the value of the feature flag
const value = await configCatClient.getValueAsync(
  // Feature flag key
  'enableParkWeatherInfo',
  // Default value - by providing `false` we specify that the feature should not be
  // enabled if the SDK fails to fetch the config or some other error occurs
  false,
  // User Object
  userObject,
);
```
