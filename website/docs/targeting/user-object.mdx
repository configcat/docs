---

The _User Object_ represents a user in your application. It is a collection of *user attributes* that store various pieces of information about the user.

The User Object is necessary to evaluate [Targeting Rules](../targeting-rule/targeting-rule-overview) and [Percentage Options](../percentage-options).
It allows you to pass the user attributes that are referenced in the rules of the feature flag to the ConfigCat SDK.

:::info
The User Object is essential if you'd like to use ConfigCat's [Targeting](../targeting-overview) feature.
:::

## The relationship between the User Object and Targeting Rules

**As a product manager**, you can define [Targeting Rules](../targeting-rule/targeting-rule-overview) on the <a href="https://app.configcat.com" target="_blank">ConfigCat Dashboard</a> based on the user attributes that are provided by your application.

**As a developer**, User Object allows you to pass user attributes to the ConfigCat SDK, which you (or your teammates) can reference in the [Targeting Rules](../targeting-rule/targeting-rule-overview) on the <a href="https://app.configcat.com" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>.

## Security and privacy concerns

ConfigCat was designed with security and privacy in mind. The feature flag evaluation process is entirely implemented within the SDKs, meaning **your users' sensitive data never leaves your system**. The data flow is one-way – from ConfigCat CDN servers to your SDKs – and ConfigCat does not receive or store any attributes of the User Object passed to the SDKs. This design prioritizes the privacy and security of user data.

## Anatomy of the User Object

The User Object offers the following properties to store user data:

| Attribute  | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Identifier | **REQUIRED.** We recommend using a user ID, email address, or session ID.                                                                                                |
| Email      | Optional. Setting this allows you to target users based on their email address. E.g.: "Turn on a feature for users with **@example.com** addresses only."                |
| Country    | Optional. Specify this for location or country-based targeting. E.g.: "Turn on a feature for users in Canada only."                                                      |
| Custom     | Optional. A map/dictionary that lets you set custom user attributes to target users based on any user data. E.g.: age, subscription type, user role, device type, app version, etc. |

### Code example

```js
const userObject = new configcat.User(
  '#UNIQUE-USER-IDENTIFIER#', // Identifier attribute (Required)
  'john@example.com', // Email attribute (Optional)
  'United Kingdom', // Country attribute (Optional)
  { // Custom attributes (Optional)
    SubscriptionType: 'Pro', 
    UserRole: 'Admin',
  },
);
```

### Identifier attribute

The unique identifier of a user in your application. This is a **REQUIRED** attribute, which enables ConfigCat to differentiate your users from each other and to evaluate Targeting Rules and Percentage Options.

Our recommendation for an identifier:

- User ID - If such an ID is available in your application, you can as well use it with ConfigCat.
- Email address - In most cases, using an email address works perfectly - as long as it is unique.
- Session ID - This is useful for targeting users who are not logged in to your application.

### Custom attributes

To use custom attributes, you need to pass a User Object containing the `custom` property to the ConfigCat SDK.

:::info
The custom attribute's value can be of multiple types: e.g. string, number, date, array of strings, etc. Check the [SDK reference](../../sdk-reference/overview) for more details.

## Examples

### Enable a feature for most valuable customers only

#### Context
Our demo company, Whisker Co. developed a new feature called **Personalized Layout** to enhance the user experience of their most valuable customers.

#### Goal
We want to enable the **Personalized Layout** feature but only for customers with a **Pro** subscription.

#### Solution
To achieve this goal, we need a custom attribute named e.g. **SubscriptionType**, which stores the subscription type of the customer.

This allows us to define a Targeting Rule that turns on the feature for the customers whose **SubscriptionType** attribute is **Pro**. Finally, we need to make sure that the "To all others" value is **OFF** so the feature is turned off for the rest of the customers.

#### Code
Add the **SubscriptionType** custom attribute to the User Object in your application code.

```js
const userObject = new configcat.User(userId, undefined, undefined, {
  SubscriptionType: 'Pro',
});
