title: OpenFeature Providers
description: List of all supported OpenFeature Providers.
---

OpenFeature is an open specification that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging. 

OpenFeature providers are the abstraction between an OpenFeature SDK and an underlying flag management system like ConfigCat. To learn more, see the [OpenFeature documentation](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/intro).

ConfigCat offers providers for the following platforms supported by OpenFeature SDKs:

- [.NET](./dotnet.mdx)
- [Angular](./angular.mdx)
- [Go](./go.mdx)
- [Java](./java.mdx)
- [JavaScript](./js.mdx)
- [Kotlin (Android)](./kotlin.mdx)
- [NestJS](./nestjs.mdx)
- [Node.js](./node.mdx)
- [PHP](./php.mdx)
- [Python](./python.mdx)
- [React](./react.mdx)
- [Ruby](./ruby.mdx)
- [Rust](./rust.mdx)
- [Swift (iOS)](./swift.mdx)

## OpenFeature Remote Evaluation Protocol (OFREP)

The <a href="https://github.com/open-feature/protocol" target="_blank">OpenFeature Remote Flag Evaluation Protocol</a> is an 
API specification for feature flagging that allows the use of generic providers to connect 
to any feature flag management systems that supports the protocol.

ConfigCat conforms OFREP via the [ConfigCat Proxy](../../advanced/proxy/overview.mdx).
The API documentation for the OFREP implementation with usage examples is available [here](../../advanced/proxy/endpoints.mdx#openfeature-remote-evaluation-protocol-ofrep).
