## A

#### [A/B Testing](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/05/02/what-is-ab-testing/)

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a product or feature to determine which one performs better. A/B testing is a form of controlled experimentation.

#### Alpha Testing

Alpha testing examines a product's functionality and compliance with the business requirements through the initial end-to-end testing.

## B

#### Beta Testing

Testing in the beta phase allows users to discover any issues or bugs before a general release by using a product in a real-world environment.

#### Blue/Green Deployment

Blue/Green deployments offer near-zero downtime and rollback capabilities. The concept of a blue/green deployment involves switching traffic between two identical environments running different versions of your application.

## C

#### [Canary Release](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/01/14/progressive-delivery/#canary-releases)

A Canary Release is a type of progressive delivery where a small percentage of users are exposed to a new feature. If the feature works as expected, the percentage of users exposed to the feature is increased. If the feature does not work as expected, the feature is rolled back.

#### [Canary Testing](https://configcat.com/canary-testing/)

Canary testing is a software deployment technique where updates or new features are rolled out to a small, carefully selected subset of users before being released to the entire user base, to test and ensure their effectiveness and safety.

#### CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline (CI/CD) is a set of steps that must be followed to deliver a new software version to customers.

#### [Continuous Delivery](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/06/13/decoupling-feature-releases-from-deployment/)

#### [Feature Branch](https://configcat.com/feature-branch/)

A feature branch is a copy of the main codebase where an individual or team of software developers can work on a new feature until it is complete.

#### [Feature Flag](https://configcat.com/featureflags/)

A feature flag is a toggle used to activate or deactivate specific features you may have in your application without redeploying code.

#### Feature Testing

An experiment to determine which version of a feature offers the best user experience is called a Feature Test.

#### [Feature Flag Framework](https://configcat.com/feature-flag-framework-explained/)

A feature flag framework is a system that allows developers to enable or disable specific functionalities of an application, enabling testing, gradual rollouts, and easy adjustments without redeploying the whole software.


#### [Feature Flagging Tools](https://configcat.com/feature-flagging-tools/)

Feature flagging tools are software utilities that enable developers to control the visibility and operational state of individual features in a software product, allowing for selective exposure and A/B testing without requiring system-wide updates or redeployments.

#### [Feature Flags as a Service](https://configcat.com/feature-flag-as-a-service/)

Providing feature flags as a service involves delivering (under a subscription model) a cloud solution for managing software features, enhancing development efficiency, risk control, and user experience.


#### [Feature Toggles](https://configcat.com/feature-toggles/)

Feature toggles, also known as feature flags, are a software development technique that allows the enabling or disabling of specific functionalities within an application, facilitating testing, incremental rollouts, and feature control without redeploying the software.


#### [Feature Toggle Management](https://configcat.com/feature-toggle-management/)

Feature toggle management refers to the process of controlling and coordinating the use of feature flags or toggles in software development, enabling developers to switch on or off certain functionalities for testing, deployment, or user experience customization.
