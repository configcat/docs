An alphabetical list of terms used around feature management and software development in general in the context of ConfigCat.

## A

#### [A/B Testing](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/05/02/what-is-ab-testing/)

A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a product or feature to determine which one performs better. A/B testing is a form of controlled experimentation.

#### Alpha Testing

Alpha testing examines a product's functionality and compliance with the business requirements through the initial end-to-end testing.

## B

#### Beta Testing

Testing in the beta phase allows users to discover any issues or bugs before a general release by using a product in a real-world environment.

#### Blue/Green Deployment

Blue/Green deployments offer near-zero downtime and rollback capabilities. The concept of a blue/green deployment involves switching traffic between two identical environments running different versions of your application.

## C

#### [Canary Release](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/01/14/progressive-delivery/#canary-releases)

A Canary Release is a type of progressive delivery where a small percentage of users are exposed to a new feature. If the feature works as expected, the percentage of users exposed to the feature is increased. If the feature does not work as expected, the feature is rolled back.

#### CI/CD Pipeline

A Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline (CI/CD) is a set of steps that must be followed to deliver a new software version to customers.

#### Continuous Delivery

A continuous delivery process enables changes - including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments - to be released into production in a safe and timely manner while maintaining sustainability.

#### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment is a process where any code changes brought to an application are released automatically into the production environment.

#### Continuous Integration

Continual Integration refers to the regular merging of code changes into a central repository, followed by automated builds and tests.

## D

#### Dark Launch

Dark launches or dark releases are releases of new features to a small group of users for feedback and improvements.

#### Developer Advocate

A developer advocate is someone whose job is to help developers be successful with a platform or a technology. A Developer Advocate also acts as a bridge between engineers and developers.

#### [DevOps Engineer](glossary/devops-engineer.md)

The DevOps Engineer is responsible for the development and maintenance of the infrastructure and the deployment of the software. The DevOps Engineer is also responsible for the monitoring and maintenance of the software and the infrastructure.

## E

## F

#### Fake Door Testing

Fake doors testing is a technique used to assess market demand for a product before investing in its development.

#### Feature Branch

A feature branch is a copy of the main codebase where an individual or team of software developers can work on a new feature until it is complete.

#### Feature Flag

A feature flag is a toggle used to activate or deactivate specific features you may have in your application without redeploying code.

#### Feature Testing

Feature testing is the process of making changes to a software system to add one or more new features or to make modifications to existing features.

#### Feature Toggle

A feature toggle in software development provides an alternative to maintaining multiple feature branches in source code.

## G

## H

## I

## J

## K

#### Kill Switch

A kill switch is a mechanism used to shut down or disable a device or program.

## L

## M

#### Multi Armed Bandit

Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) is a Machine Learning framework in which an agent has to select actions (arms) in order to maximize its cumulative reward in the long term.

## N

## O

## P

#### Product Lifecycle Manager

A product lifecycle manager is in charge of overseeing the work of the project team and making sure they complete each phase of a project's lifecycle on time.

#### [Progressive Delivery](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/01/14/progressive-delivery/)

A progressive delivery approach to DevOps combines the principles of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) with modern software development practices, facilitating faster code deployment, reducing risk, and improving user experiences.

## Q

## R

#### Release Manager

A release manager is an IT practitioner who helps define and oversee the release management process at a company.

#### Remote Configuration

Remote configuration is a software development technique that allows you to modify certain features of an app remotely without having to deploy a new version of the app.

#### Ring Deployment --rewrite,stolen

Ring deployment is a form of gradual rollout where new features are released gradually to different groups of users to mitigate risk.

## S

#### Site Reliability Engineer

A site reliability engineer is an IT expert who uses automation tools to monitor and observe software reliability in the production environment.

#### Smoke Test

Smoke testing is performed at the beginning of the development process to ensure that the most important features of an application are working properly.

#### Soak Testing

Soak Testing is a type of non functional testing that is used to measure performance of a software application under a huge volume of load for an extended period of time.

#### Software Development Life Cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time.

## T

#### Type I and Type II Errors

A Type I error means rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true, while a Type II error means failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false.

#### Trunk Based Development

Trunk-based development is a version control management practice where developers merge small, frequent updates to a core “trunk” or main branch.

## U

#### User Acceptance Testing

is a phase of software development in which the software is tested in the "real world" by the intended audience or business representative.

## V

#### Version Control

Version control — also known as source control or revision control — is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. It is closely related to source code management.
