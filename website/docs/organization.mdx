An _Organization_ represents a collection of preferences that apply to all your _Products_ and _Members_ in that _Organization_.
This includes things like billing information, sign-in methods, and data privacy settings.

The _Manage Organization menu_ is only available for _Organization Admins_.

## Organization Admin role

_Organization Admins_ have full access to the entire organization and all products. For example, they can:

- Add or remove members
- Set up security settings
- Change sign-in methods
- Create or delete products, feature flags, and environments

They **do not** have access to billing or subscription settings unless they are also _Billing Managers_.

Only _Organization Admins_ can assign or remove the _Organization Admin_ role from others.

## Billing Manager role

Only _Billing Managers_ can:

- View and update billing information
- Change the subscription plan
- Assign or remove the _Billing Manager_ role from others

_Billing Managers_ **cannot** access products, environments, configs, or feature flags, unless they are also _Organization Admins_.
