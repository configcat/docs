OpenFeature is an open specification that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging. 

OpenFeature providers are the abstraction between an OpenFeature SDK and an underlying flag management system like ConfigCat. To learn more, see the [OpenFeature documentation](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/intro).

ConfigCat offers providers for the following platforms supported by OpenFeature SDKs:

- [Java](./java.mdx)
