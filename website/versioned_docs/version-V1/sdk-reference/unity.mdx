:::info
This documentation applies to the **v8.x version** of the ConfigCat .NET SDK. For the documentation of the latest release, please refer to [this page](../../../docs/sdk-reference/unity.mdx).

## Getting Started

ConfigCat provides support for feature flagging in Unity applications and games via the [ConfigCat .NET SDK](./dotnet.mdx).

However, compared to an ordinary .NET application, the installation process is different in Unity and requires a bit of extra effort.
(Mainly because Unity doesn't support NuGet packages and uses .NET as a scripting platform.)

### 1. Get the SDK assembly files

Since NuGet packages cannot be referenced in Unity projects directly, the SDK's assembly file (`ConfigCat.Client.dll`) and its dependencies must be added manually.

So, as a first step, you will need to get the assembly .dll files for `netstandard2.0` from the following packages:
* [ConfigCat.Client v8.0.0+](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConfigCat.Client)
* [Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces v6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces/6.0.0)
* [System.Buffers v4.5.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Buffers/4.5.1)
* [System.Memory v4.5.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/4.5.4)
* [System.Numerics.Vectors v4.5.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Numerics.Vectors/4.5.0)
* [System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe v6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/6.0.0)
* [System.Text.Encodings.Web v6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Encodings.Web/6.0.0)
* [System.Text.Json v6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json/6.0.0)
* [System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions v4.5.4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions/4.5.4)

You can do this by downloading these packages and extracting the .dll files manually from the .nupkg files (which are actually plain ZIP files).

Or, if you have [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) installed, you can take a shortcut:
1. Create a file named `Plugins.csproj` (anywhere in your file system) with the following content:
   ```xml
   <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
     <PropertyGroup>
       <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
     </PropertyGroup>
     <ItemGroup>
       <PackageReference Include="ConfigCat.Client" Version="*" />
     </ItemGroup>
   </Project>
   ```
1. Run `dotnet publish -c Release` in the same folder.
1. You will now have all the necessary .dll files in the `bin/Release/netstandard2.0/publish` folder.

### 2. Add the SDK assembly files to your Unity project

Create a folder named `Plugins` in your Unity project's Assets, then copy the SDK assembly files into this folder.

### 3. Create a script for hosting the _ConfigCat_ client

To access your feature flags, you will need to create an instance of `ConfigCatClient` with your SDK Key.
Usually you do this once, at the start of your application or game, then use the client throughout its lifetime.

However, sharing object instances between scripts is not straightforward in Unity. We recommend the following approach:

Create a folder named `Scripts` in your Unity project's Assets, then add a C# Script named `SingletonServices` to it.
Replace the script content with the following code:

```cs
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using System.Threading;
using ConfigCat.Client;
using UnityEngine;

public class SingletonServices : MonoBehaviour
{
    private static SingletonServices instance;
    public static SingletonServices Instance => instance;

    [field: NonSerialized]
    public IConfigCatClient ConfigCatClient { get; private set; }

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (Interlocked.CompareExchange(ref instance, this, null) is not null)
        {
            // If another instance has been created already, get rid of this one.
            Destroy(this);
            return;
        }

        ConfigCatClient = ConfigCat.Client.ConfigCatClient.Get("YOUR_SDK_KEY", options =>
        {
            options.Logger = new ConfigCatToUnityDebugLogAdapter(LogLevel.Warning);
        });

        DontDestroyOnLoad(this.gameObject);
    }

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start() { }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update() { }

    private void OnDestroy()
    {
        this.ConfigCatClient?.Dispose();
        this.ConfigCatClient = null;
    }

    private sealed class ConfigCatToUnityDebugLogAdapter : IConfigCatLogger
    {
        private readonly LogLevel logLevel;

        public ConfigCatToUnityDebugLogAdapter(LogLevel logLevel)
        {
            this.logLevel = logLevel;
        }

        public LogLevel LogLevel
        {
            get => this.logLevel;
            set { throw new NotSupportedException(); }
        }

        public void Log(LogLevel level, LogEventId eventId, ref FormattableLogMessage message, Exception exception = null)
        {
            var eventIdString = eventId.Id.ToString(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
            var exceptionString = exception is null ? string.Empty : Environment.NewLine + exception;
            var logMessage = $"ConfigCat[{eventIdString}] {message.InvariantFormattedMessage}{exceptionString}";
            switch (level)
            {
                case LogLevel.Error:
                    Debug.LogError(logMessage);
                    break;
                case LogLevel.Warning:
                    Debug.LogWarning(logMessage);
                    break;
                case LogLevel.Info:
                    Debug.Log(logMessage);
                    break;
                case LogLevel.Debug:
                    Debug.Log(logMessage);
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::caution
In case your application or game targets WebGL, this won't work. WebGL is not supported currently.
:::

Finally, to activate the `SingletonServices` script, add an empty GameObject to your first scene and assign the script to it.

### 4. Get your setting value

Once the setup above is done, you will be able to access the _ConfigCat_ client in your other scripts and use it to evaluate feature flags and settings:

```cs
var configCatClient = SingletonServices.Instance.ConfigCatClient;

var isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled = await configCatClient.GetValueAsync("isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled", false);
if (isMyAwesomeFeatureEnabled)
{
    doTheNewThing();
}
else
{
    doTheOldThing();
}
```
